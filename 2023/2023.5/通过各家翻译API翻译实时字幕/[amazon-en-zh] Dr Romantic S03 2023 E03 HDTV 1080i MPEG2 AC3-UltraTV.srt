(浪漫博士 3 季)
(DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3)

2
00:01:57,002 --> 00:02:01,923
这部电视剧中的角色、地点、组织和事件都是虚构的作品
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

3
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:16,229
一般来说，把它记得很重要。
Generally speaking, it's important to make it down well.

4
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:18,982
但是这个叫做骄傲的该死的东西
But this darn thing called pride

5
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,901
让男人表现得小气。
makes a man act petty.

6
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:23,862
往前看，明白了吗？
Look far ahead, got it?

7
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:26,281
-还有...-如果你反正要倒下，
- Also… - If you're going down anyway,

8
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:29,701
你做起来不妨看起来很酷。... 放松一点！
you might as well look cool doing it. …loosen up a little!

9
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:31,202
戴上护目镜！
Put your goggles on!

10
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:35,707
但是贪婪和傲慢让你很努力。
But greed and arrogance make you try so hard.

11
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,251
-只有在你变成失事之后...-明白了吗？
- Only after you become a wreck… - Got it?

12
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:42,088
... 你最终能放手吗。
…will you finally be able to let it go.

13
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,391
这风...
This wind…

14
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,352
别跳。不！不要！
Don't jump. No! Don't!

15
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:58,813
我告诉你，别跳！
Don't jump, I tell you!

16
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,335
男人没办法吗
Is there no way for a man

17
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:22,962
看起来很优雅
to look graceful

18
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,173
跌倒时？
while falling?

19
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:33,098
你这话是什么意思？
What do you mean by that?

20
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,058
我加入你们只有一个条件。
There is only one condition for me to join you.

21
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:39,896
你将把卜勇珠从突潭医院创伤中心带走。
You will remove Bu Yongju from Doldam Hospital Trauma Center.

22
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:47,320
我们不能就你的工资或其他条件达成协议吗？
Can't we reach an agreement with your salary or any other condition?

23
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,906
我不是要做个交易，朴主任。
I'm not asking to make a deal, Director Park.

24
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,077
教授，没有金大师我们就无法管理创伤中心。
Professor, we can't run the Trauma Center without Master Kim.

25
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:56,121
这是不可思议的。
It's unimaginable.

26
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:58,623
那我们就忘记我们曾经讨论过这个问题了。
Then let's forget we ever discussed this.

27
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:09,592
查金曼教授
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN

28
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,779
是我。
It's me.

29
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,824
你想什么时候开始？
When do you want to start?

30
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,242
你想让我什么时候开始？
When would you like me to start?

31
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,661
一周后怎么样？
How about in one week?

32
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,497
届时我会和金大师谈谈。
I'll talk to Master Kim by then.

33
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:43,251
当然，你将不得不面对其他医生的抵制。
Of course, you will have to deal with resistance from the other doctors.

34
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,211
我已经准备好处理这么多问题了。
I'm prepared to deal with that much.

35
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:48,590
在你开始工作之前，请让我知道其他细节。
And let me know about other details before you start work.

36
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,091
好吧。
Okay.

37
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,511
是的。到时见。
Yes. I'll see you then.

38
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:08,484
他说他会做的。
He says he'll do it.

39
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,283
干得好，朴主任。
Good work, Director Park.

40
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,202
-金大师。-是吗？
- Master Kim. - Yes?

41
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,163
我可以问你为什么吗？
May I ask you why?

42
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:22,916
你为什么做出这样的决定？
Why did you make such a decision?

43
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,585
你确定我们需要他
You determined that we need him

44
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:27,253
并想把他带到这里。
and wanted to bring him here.

45
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,966
尽管如此，我不想让创伤中心没有你。
Still, I didn't want the Trauma Center without you there.

46
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,509
创伤中心...
The Trauma Center…

47
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:37,805
一直是你长期以来的梦想。
had been a longtime dream of yours.

48
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,933
把它拿走就是作弊。
Taking that away would be cheating.

49
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,309
朴导演
Director Park.

50
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:44,687
你知道怎么把大象放进冰箱吗？
Do you know how to put an elephant into a fridge?

51
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,107
答案很简单。
The answer is simple.

52
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,151
把门打开
Open the door.

53
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,820
把大象放进去。然后，关上门。
Put the elephant inside. Then, close the door.

54
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:54,906
金大师
Master Kim.

55
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,825
但仅仅因为某件事很简单
But just because something is simple

56
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,203
并不意味着任何人都能做到。
doesn't mean anyone can do it.

57
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:03,957
简单的解决方案并不容易。
A simple solution doesn't make it easy.

58
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,714
你和我刚刚抓住了门把手。
You and I have only just grabbed the doorknob.

59
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,279
查金曼教授！给我一个我儿子的死的答案！
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN! GIVE ME AN ANSWER FOR MY SON'S DEATH!

60
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:51,337
查金曼教授！给我一个我儿子的死的答案！
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN! GIVE ME AN ANSWER FOR MY SON'S DEATH!

61
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:02,140
（第 3 卷）把大象放进冰箱，第 2 部分
(VOLUME 3) PUTTING AN ELEPHANT IN A FRIDGE, PART 2

62
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,351
这是多尔达姆医院的急诊室。
This is the Doldam Hospital ER.

63
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,187
是的，明白了。
Yes, got it.

64
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:11,190
张博士，急诊病人在三分钟后就到了。
Dr. Jang, an emergency patient is arriving in three minutes.

65
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,818
哦，好吧。你能帮他包扎一下吗？
Oh, okay. Can you bandage him up, please?

66
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,986
是的，医生。
Yes, Doctor.

67
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:19,073
哦，你得看看八号床上的撕裂伤口。
Oh, and you need to look at the laceration wound in bed eight.

68
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:20,241
撕裂伤口？好吧。
Laceration wound? Okay.

69
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:23,494
张博士，二号床的病人的X光片出来了。
Dr. Jang, the X-ray is out for the patient in bed two.

70
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:25,454
好吧。
Okay.

71
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:29,857
哦，我们该怎么处理胃痛的病人？
Oh, what should we do about the patient with the stomachache?

72
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:31,294
我会做的。
I'll do it.

73
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,546
张博士！八号床上的裂伤口。
Dr. Jang! The laceration wound in bed eight.

74
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,341
-他们已经等了一段时间了。-好吧。
- They've been waiting for a while. - Okay.

75
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:38,217
医生，血太多了。
Doctor, there's so much blood.

76
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,219
医生，请看这里。
Doctor, please take a look here.

77
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:41,888
-医生。-我们先来过这里。

78
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:43,681
-但这很紧急。-医生。

79
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:45,085
-等一下。-请帮帮我们。
- Just a moment. - Please help us.

80
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,226
-医生。-我们先来过这里。
- Doctor. - We were here first.

81
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,186
-医生？-医生！
- Doctor? - Doctor!

82
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,354
-对不起。-医生。
- Excuse me. - Doctor.

83
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:51,773
Jung Insu 博士和 Yoon Areum 还没来吗？
Are Dr. Jung Insu and Yoon Areum not here yet?

84
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:54,108
荣格博士去见了导演。
Dr. Jung went to a meeting with the director.

85
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,027
而且 Yoon 博士还没来上班。
And Dr. Yoon hasn't come to work yet.

86
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:57,612
说真的...
Seriously…

87
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,155
我们有病人！
We have a patient!

88
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,657
发生了车祸。
There was a car crash.

89
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,869
腹部有穿透性伤口。BP 是 80/40。心率 120。
A penetrating wound in the abdomen. BP is 80/40. Heart rate 120.

90
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,668
他的血压太低了。我们该怎么办，张博士？
His BP is too low. What should we do, Dr. Jang?

91
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:15,588
张博士！那胃痛的病人呢？
Dr. Jang! What about the stomachache patient?

92
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:18,257
张博士！八号床上的裂伤口！

93
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,134

等等... 等一下。
Wait… just a minute.

96
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:24,639
-八号床！-你在干什么？

97
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:27,266
-请快来！-很紧急！
- Please come quickly! - It's urgent!

98
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,394
-张博士！-张博士！

00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,479
在这里！
Over here!

100
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:38,277
你现在在干什么？
What are you doing right now?

101
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,071
抓紧吧，朋克！
Get a grip, punk!

102
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:48,371
我们祝你身体健康
WE WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH

103
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:59,799
他刚站起来睡着了，对吧？
He just fell asleep standing up, right?

104
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,717
我想他甚至做了一个梦。
I think he even had a dream.

105
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:06,639
你一定很累，张博士。
You must be very tired, Dr. Jang.

106
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,433
是的...
Yes…

107
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:09,851
我没事。
I'm okay.

108
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,148
这是个急诊病人！
It's an emergency patient!

109
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:24,449
这是个26岁的男性。他是国家跳台滑雪队的一员。
It's a 26-year-old male. He's on the national ski jump team.

110
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:27,160
他在训练中着陆时受伤。
He was injured while making a landing during training.

111
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:28,995
他的生命体征是 126/82 和 68。
His vitals are 126/82 and 68.

112
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,581
他似乎没有任何外伤，
He doesn't seem to have any external injuries,

113
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,144
但他正遭受极度痛苦。
but he's suffering from extreme pain.

114
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,419
-让我们让他坐混合动力车或。-好吧。
- Let's get him in the hybrid OR. - Okay.

115
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,297
请在这里等着。
Please wait here.

116
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
你不来吗？
Aren't you coming?

117
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:47,263
那郑仁秀博士和尹阿雷姆博士呢？
What about Dr. Jung Insu and Dr. Yoon Areum?

118
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:49,223
荣格博士正在和导演会面。
Dr. Jung is in a meeting with the director.

119
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:51,017
而且 Yoon 博士还没来上班。
And Dr. Yoon hasn't come to work yet.

120
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:54,770
张博士
Dr. Jang.

121
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:56,063
张博士，快点。
Dr. Jang, hurry.

122
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:05,948
-哦，你在这里。-是的，你好。
- Oh, you're here. - Yes, hello.

123
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:10,077
把它放进去。不，不在那里。就是这样。
Put that inside. No, not there. That's it.

124
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,581
等等！这是新的。一定不要碰它。
Wait! That's new. Make sure not to bump it.

125
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,542
-是的，就是这样。-你在干什么？
- Yes, that's it. - What are you doing?

126
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:19,295
哦，徐博士。你刚来上班吗？
Oh, Dr. Seo. Are you just coming to work?

127
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:21,881
今天将有一位新的 CT 外科研究员加入我们。
A new CT surgical fellow will be joining us today.

128
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:23,758
我一直在为他们重新安排。
I've been rearranging for them.

129
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:26,469
Cha Eunjae 要搬到这个房间吗？
Is Cha Eunjae moving to this room?

130
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:29,305
没错。从现在起普通外科医生将待在一个房间里
That's right. From now on, general surgeons will be in one room,

131
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:30,788
而且 CT 外科医生会去另一个地方。
and CT surgeons will be in another.

132
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,433
你将拥有自己的专长。
You will be with your own specialty.

133
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,479
但是，为什么有三张办公桌？
But, why are there three desks?

134
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:40,942
我不确定。朴明国导演让我再准备一份。
I'm not sure. Director Park Minguk asked me to prepare another.

135
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:44,111
无论如何，我简直不敢相信我能目睹这个景象。
Anyway, I can't believe I get to witness this sight.

136
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:47,615
看来只是昨天我们只用金师傅来管理医院。
It seems only yesterday we ran the hospital with just Master Kim.

137
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:51,285
老实说，当姜东柱博士和尹瑞贞博士加入我们的时候，
Honestly, when Dr. Kang Dongju and Dr. Yoon Seojeong joined us,

138
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,413
我从来没有想过金大师的梦想会成真。
I never imagined that Master Kim's dream would come true.

139
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:57,959
但是有一个房间里挤满了普通外科医生
But one room is overflowing with general surgeons,

140
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:00,753
另一个房间里挤满了心胸外科医生。
and another room is full of cardiothoracic surgeons.

141
00:11:00,836 --> 00:11:03,798
最重要的是，创伤中心站得很高。
On top of that, the Trauma Center is standing tall.

142
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:07,051
我深受感动。
I am so deeply moved.

143
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,014
嘿，一个男人在说话。
Hey, a man is talking.

144
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:14,392
天哪，他怎么会这么缺乏社交能力？
Gosh, how could he be so lacking in social skills?

145
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:16,936
我的天哪！对不起，放轻松点。
My goodness! Sorry, go easy on that.

146
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,308
嘿，你在这里。
Hey, you're here.

147
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,582
-你整晚都在工作吗？-当然。
- Did you work all night? - Of course.

148
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:01,741
我正在待命。我当然工作了一整夜。
I was on call. Of course I worked all night.

149
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,482
我眨眼就睡不着觉。
I couldn't sleep a wink.

150
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:04,859
你刚才不是在睡觉吗？
Weren't you sleeping just now?

151
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,153
睡觉？谁？
Sleeping? Who?

152
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,196
我没睡。
I wasn't sleeping.

153
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,162
我给你带了些番茄汁。
I brought you some tomato juice.

154
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,414
在混合之前我把它们漂白了。
I blanched them before blending it.

155
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:19,832
味道应该还可以。
It should taste okay.

156
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,417
你自己做的？
You made it yourself?

157
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:24,670
-你还把它们漂白了？-是的。
- You even blanched them? - Yes.

158
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,089
我甚至自己把它们烫了。
I even blanched them myself.

159
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:29,467
嘿，这是什么？
Hey, what is this?

160
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:33,262
只要吃几个西红柿你就会很感动。
You're quite moving with just a few tomatoes.

161
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:38,809
当你在玩的时候，也为我打开盖子。拜托？
While you're at it, open the lid for me too. Please?

162
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,186
请问漂亮吗？
Pretty please?

163
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:50,404
对不起，我还半睡着了。
Sorry, I'm still half asleep.

164
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:52,114
我的舌头还没完全清醒。
My tongue isn't completely awake yet.

165
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:55,116
嗯！
Mmm!

166
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,412
这味道不错。太新鲜了。
This tastes good. It's so fresh.

167
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:02,541
请忘记你刚才听到的内容。你能做到吗？
Please forget what you just heard. Can you do that?

168
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,127
不，我不能。
No, I can't.

169
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:08,130
这是我的短暂错误，因为我累了。
It was a momentary error on my part because I was tired.

170
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:09,632
请忘记这件事，好吗？
Please forget about it, okay?

171
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:10,715
我不想。
I don't want to.

172
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:12,426
“拜托了。”
"Pretty please."

173
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,886
你又去了。
There you go again.

174
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:16,180
这个会持续一段时间。什么？“请问漂亮吗？”
This one will last a while. What? "Pretty please?"

175
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,682
停下来，徐宇镇。
Stop it, Seo Woojin.

176
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:18,766
-“请问漂亮吗？”-嘿。
- "Pretty please?" - Hey.

177
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:20,184
-漂亮...-嘘。
- Pretty... - Hush.

178
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:22,036
-可能有人能听见。-好吧，我停下来。
- Someone might hear. - Okay, I'll stop.

179
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:25,439
-但是 “请问漂亮吗？”好吧，我停下来。-说真的，我说停下来。
- But "pretty please?" Okay, I'll stop. - Seriously, I said stop.

Dr. Lee Seonung. This is Dr. Seo Woojin in general surgery.

It's good to see you. I hope we get along.

187
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,468
拜托了。
Pretty please.

188
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:56,761
什么？
What?

189
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,894
这是急诊室打来的电话。
It's a call from the ER.

190
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,689
待会儿见，车恩才博士。

祝你有美好的一天。

192
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,698
他刚才说了什么？
What did he just say?

193
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:17,575
哦，别介意他。
Oh, don't mind him.

194
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,870
有时候他就是这样。他甚至不好笑，但他尝试了。
He's just like that sometimes. He's not even funny, but he tries.

195
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:22,356
但是他一点都不好笑，对吧？
But he's not funny at all, right?

196
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,331
天哪，说真的。
Gosh, seriously.

197
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:29,170
你喜欢番茄汁吗？
Do you like tomato juice?

198
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,254
是的。
Yes.

199
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:32,965
我们有什么？
What do we have?

200
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:37,011
他是国家跳台滑雪队的一员。他在着陆时受伤。
He's on the national ski jump team. He was injured while landing.

201
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,930
裴文正医生正在检查他的膝盖韧带。

202
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,349
但他一直说自己有胃痛。

203
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,684
-那CT呢？-那个 CT...

204
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,104
CT 显示前腹部的一部分壁增强。
The CT shows wall enhancement in a part of the front abdomen.

205
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:48,981
我认为我们需要进行手术观察。
I think we need to do a surgical observation.

206
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:50,941
-就在这里？-是的。
- Right here? - Yes.

207
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:57,031
但是在后面，通气看起来不错，而且尺寸很小。
But in the back, the aeration looks good and the size is small.

208
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:59,658
我认为增强只是肠道肿胀所致。
I think the enhancement is just from the swollen bowels.

209
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,702
没错，但是...
That's true, but…

210
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,749
-腹泻怎么样？-没有。

00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,170
身体状况？
Physical condition?

RLQ 里有点温柔。
There's some tenderness in the RLQ.

215
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,006
而且没有反弹吗？
And there's no rebound?

216
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,925
它并不突出。
It's not prominent.

217
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:17,968
要么在那里，要么没有。
It's either there or not.

218
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:19,678
你说的不突出是什么意思？
What do you mean by not prominent?

219
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:22,139
病人一直说很痛。
The patient keeps saying it hurts.

220
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,600
-病人在哪里？-在混合动力手术室里

221
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:32,650
膝盖韧带没有问题。
There's nothing wrong with the knee ligaments.

222
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,236
对，我说了同样的话，
Right, I said the same thing,

223
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:37,404
但是病人一直说很痛。
but the patient keeps saying that it hurts.

224
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,490
对不起。
Excuse me.

225
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:43,160
三年前他接受了前交叉韧带手术。
He had surgery on his ACL three years ago.

226
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:46,121
哦，但是现在看来还不错。
Oh, but it seems fine now.

227
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,582
我的胃好痛。
My stomach hurts so much.

228
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,335
哦，我的胃。它要死我了。
Oh, my stomach. It's killing me.

229
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:54,713
让我来看看。
Let me take a look.

230
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,632
嘿，徐博士。你在这里。
Hey, Dr. Seo. You're here.

231
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,176
病人一直抱怨胃痛。
The patient keeps complaining about stomach pain.

232
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,471
但是 CT 扫描中没有任何特别之处。
But there isn't anything in particular in the CT scan.

233
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,018
先生，对不起。
Sir, excuse me for a minute.

234
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:09,895
抬起你的膝盖。
Bring your knee up.

235
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,025
-我按这里会痛吗？-是的。
- Does it hurt if I press here? - Yes.

236
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,902
那这边呢？
What about this side?

237
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,445
右边还受伤吗？
Does the right side still hurt?

238
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:19,864
是的，确实如此。
Yes, it does.

239
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:22,658
让我看看你的衣服底下。
Let me look under your clothes.

240
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:26,912
如果我像这样点击它会怎样？
What if I tap on it like this?

241
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:27,997
那也很痛。
That hurts too.

242
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,748
你能用力咳嗽吗？
Can you cough with some force?

243
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:37,608
你感觉到肚子里有铃声吗？
Do you feel a ringing in your stomach?

244
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:38,841
是的，我能感觉到。
Yes, I feel it.

245
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:43,888
让我们尝试不同的位置并进行比较。
Let's try a different position and compare.

246
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,307
抬起你的腿。收紧肌肉。
Lift your legs. Tighten your muscles.

247
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,475
抬起头，看看你的膝盖。
Lift your head and look at your knees.

248
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:57,151
哪一个更痛？早点还是现在？

249
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:59,028
这更痛。
This hurts more.

250
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,157
好吧。你现在可以放松了。

00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:05,992
张东华.
Jang Donghwa.

252
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:07,036
是吗？
Yes?

253
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:09,413
你查过卡内特的牌子了吗？
Did you check for Carnett's sign?

254
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,873
我做到了...
I did…

255
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:12,836
那你为什么建议做手术观察？
Then why did you suggest a surgical observation?

256
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,335
根本没有肌肉防护。
There's no muscle guarding at all.

257
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,130
对不起。这是什么？有什么不对吗？
Excuse me. What is it? Is something wrong?

258
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:21,675
没什么大不了的。这是一种常见的疾病
It's nothing big. It's a common illness

259
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,259
称为假装。
called faking.

260
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:33,646
这是什么？
What is this?

261
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,273
你是故意着陆时摔倒的吗？
Did you fall while landing on purpose?

262
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:38,984
不，我没有。我真的很受伤。
No, I didn't. I really am hurting.

263
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:40,903
你为什么不相信我？
Why won't you believe me?

264
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:44,031
整形外科医生和我都同意。
The orthopedic surgeon and I agree.

265
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:46,200
考试成绩没有问题。
There is nothing wrong with the exam results.

266
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:47,993
真是一堆嘎嘎声！
What a bunch of quacks!

267
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,995
如果考试成绩还好，一切都好吗？
Is it all fine if the exam results are fine?

268
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,206
我告诉你我很痛苦！
I'm telling you I'm in pain!

269
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,750
你这个可怜的傻瓜！
You pathetic fool!

270
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,419
比赛还有几天的时间。这是什么？
The competition is days away. What is this?

271
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:02,007
在这个不敬虔的时刻，你把我们的时间浪费在任何事情上！
You wasted our time fussing over nothing, at this ungodly hour!

272
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:04,051
我真的很痛苦！
I really was in pain!

273
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:07,388
算了吧，朋克！为什么，我应该把你撕成碎片。
Forget it, punk! Why, I ought to rip you apart.

274
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:10,057
先生，你不能在这里这么大声说话...
Sir, you can't speak so loudly here...

275
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,519
你认为赢得一枚金牌是一项巨大的成就吗？
Do you think winning one gold medal is a huge accomplishment?

276
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:16,397
你呢？不要自欺欺人。
Do you? Don't flatter yourself.

277
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,023
明白了吗？
Got it?

278
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:21,568
奖牌只是你生命中的一个小圆点。
A medal is just a tiny dot in your life.

279
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,655
你所做的只是在地图上打了一个点。
All you did was put a dot on the map.

280
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,199
你不是大人物。
You're no big shot.

281
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:29,535
你傲慢自大，甚至不会练习。
You're stiff with arrogance and won't even practice.

282
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:30,828
现在，你假装受伤了？
And now, you fake an injury?

283
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,080
你...
You…

284
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,980
你知道如果你因傲慢而变得过于僵硬会发生什么吗？
Do you know what happens if you get too stiff with arrogance?

285
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,794
即使是最轻微的错误也可能导致巨大的伤害。
Even the slightest error can lead to a huge injury.

286
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:40,838
明白了吗？
Got that?

287
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:43,007
一个人的生活也是一样的。
A person's life is the same way.

288
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:44,675
朋克。
Punk.

289
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:51,598
天哪，对不起。
Gosh, I'm sorry.

290
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:58,856
你在干什么？快起来！
What are you doing? Get up already!

291
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,747
天哪，那个教练太吓人了。
Gosh, that coach is scary.

292
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,499
他一定已经伪造过好几次了。
He must've faked it several times already.

293
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,420
放开他是对的吗？他说他很痛苦。
Is it right to let him go? He says he's in pain.

294
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:24,256
不过，我们无能为力。
Still, there's nothing we can do.

295
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,342
我也是这么想的。我敢肯定他们有团队医生。
That's what I think too. I'm sure they have team doctors.

296
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:29,720
让我们尽我们所能，荣格博士。
Let's just do what we can, Dr. Jung.

297
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,931
好吧，如果操作系统和GS是这么说的。
Okay, if that's what OS and GS say.

298
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:34,808
我现在要让他出院。
I'll discharge him for now.

299
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:44,692
对不起。
Excuse me.

300
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,030
关于赵成允先生...
About Mr. Cho Sungyoon…

301
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,866
我们不能给他静脉注射然后让他休息几个小时吗？
Couldn't we give him an IV and let him rest for a few hours?

302
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,951
那是什么意思？
What does that mean?

303
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,204
压力也是一种疾病。
Stress is a type of illness too.

304
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,332
休息几天他就能好起来。
He could get better with a few days of rest.

305
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:01,627
GS 外科医生从什么时候开始控制患者的压力水平？
Since when did GS surgeons start to manage patients' stress levels?

306
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:03,753
对不起？
Pardon?

307
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:08,050
对，医生可以同情病人。
Right, a doctor can feel sympathetic for a patient.

308
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,677
但仅此而已。
But that's all.

309
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,306
你叫我做我该做的事。
You told me to do what I had to do.

310
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,603
我的意思是你应该在工作中尽力而为。
I meant you should do your best at your job.

311
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:21,563
你刚才做的就是太过分了。
What you just did is go overboard.

312
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,066
不要混淆这两个。
Don't confuse those two.

313
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:32,407
说真的。
Seriously.

314
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,330
信息
INFORMATION

315
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:40,165
一定是缺乏技巧，对吧？
It must be a lack of finesse, right?

316
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,919
-徐博士，我的意思是。-嗯。
- Dr. Seo, I mean. - Mm.

317
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:47,506
我想他说的话是为了教张博士
I think he says what he says to teach Dr. Jang,

318
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:49,883
但是张博士似乎被他的话弄伤了。
but Dr. Jang seems to be hurt by his words.

319
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:55,681
我感觉就像在你早年的时候在看着你。
I feel like I'm watching you in your early days.

320
00:20:58,725 --> 00:20:59,726
天哪。
Gosh.

321
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:03,522
杨浩俊不是负责居民的吗？
Wasn't Yang Hojun in charge of the residents?

322
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:05,566
是的，他本应如此。
Yes, he was supposed to be.

323
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,318
我敢肯定他把它传给了徐博士。
I'm sure he passed it on to Dr. Seo.

324
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,529
无论如何，他是世界上最好的
Anyway, he's the world's best

325
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:13,157
太无耻了，没有责任感。
at being shameless and having no sense of responsibility.

326
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:23,458
所以...
So…

327
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:27,087
你不能清理这两者之间的交通吗？
can't you clear up some traffic between those two?

328
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:30,215
天哪，别烦他们。
Gosh, leave them alone.

329
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,677
如果成年人喜欢这些事情
If grown-ups butt in for these things,

330
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,180
这只会使事情变得更加复杂。
it will only make things more complicated.

331
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:40,475
他们需要在头上碰头然后紧紧抓住头部。
They need to butt heads and bond over it.

332
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,936
他们就是这样长大的。
That's how they'll grow up.

333
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:50,527
张东华博士！
Dr. Jang Donghwa!

334
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:54,031
对金仁国先生来说太棒了
Suction for Mr. Kim Inguk.

335
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,494
在接下来的一个小时里留意这个病人。
Keep an eye on this patient for the next hour.

336
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:13,889
他是一名患有肠梗阻的糖尿病患者。
He's a diabetic with an intestinal obstruction.

337
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,207
你应该怎么排便？
How should you do a bowel rest?

338
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:18,013
他不应该口服任何东西然后给他静脉注射。
He should take nothing by mouth and give him an IV.

339
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:20,641
那是他没有糖尿病的时候。
That's when he isn't diabetic.

340
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:22,726
一位糖尿病患者
A diabetic patient

341
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,061
可能会进入低血糖。
could go into hypoglycemia.

342
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:25,864
所以你应该给他 TPN，而不仅仅是液体。
So you should give him TPN, not just fluids.

343
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:28,273
哦，对。
Oh, right.

344
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:55,884
如果我发现你又在医院玩游戏
If I catch you playing games in the hospital again,

345
00:22:55,968 --> 00:22:57,427
你将加班两个小时。
you'll work two hours of overtime.

346
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:00,931
如果你愿意，可以试试看。
Try it if you want to.

347
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,603
张东华
JANG DONGHWA

348
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,029
张医生，你查过明天的手术时间表了吗？
Dr. Jang, have you checked tomorrow's surgery schedule?

349
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:19,700
我现在在做。
I'm on it now.

350
00:23:20,117 --> 00:23:21,118
说真的。
Seriously.

351
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,993
昨天腹部受伤患者的报告在哪里？
Where is the report on yesterday's abdomen injury patient?

352
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:36,717
我现在就做。
I'll do it now.

353
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:55,861
别忘了在今天下午之前整理病例报告。
Don't forget to organize the case report by this afternoon.

354
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:57,487
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

355
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,530
你累了吗？
Are you tired?

356
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,032
不，先生。
No, sir.

357
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,080
是的，有点。
Yes, a bit.

358
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,082
这意味着你做得很好。
That means you're doing well.

359
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,250
开始吧。
Here you go.

360
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:54,668
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

361
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,270
哦，你在这里。
Oh, there you are.

362
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,439
你做过手术吗？
Did you have surgery?

363
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,316
我有一些练习要做。
I had some practice to do.

364
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:19,069
我现在完成了。
I'm done now.

365
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,155
很难，不是吗？
It's hard, isn't it?

366
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,659
好吧，没关系。
Well, it's fine.

367
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:29,830
放轻松。
Take it easy.

368
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:32,374
简单。
Easy.

369
00:25:39,965 --> 00:25:42,008
我打赌他不明白。
I'm betting that he didn't understand.

370
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:46,179
你这么认为吗？
Do you think so?

371
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:49,641
即使对于一个头脑冷静的男人来说
Even for a cool-headed man,

372
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:54,271
对自己保持客观不是一件容易的事，金大师。
being objective about himself is not an easy thing, Master Kim.

373
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:02,696
顺便说一句，你说你想告诉我一件事。
By the way, you said you wanted to tell me something.

374
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:04,990
这是什么？
What is it?

375
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
什么？
What?

376
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,412
创伤中心的新负责人？
A new head of the Trauma Center?

377
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,830
谁？
Who?

378
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,374
好吧，
Well,

379
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:18,170
我也不确定这些传闻是否属实。
I'm not sure if the rumors are true either.

380
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:23,425
我听说查金曼博士将出任创伤中心主任。
I hear Dr. Cha Jinman will be coming as head of the Trauma Center.

381
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:25,594
查金满博士，你的意思是...
By Dr. Cha Jinman, do you mean…

382
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:28,221
车恩才的爸爸？
Cha Eunjae's dad?

383
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:29,598
是的。
Yes.

384
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:46,072
希望，爱，服务
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

385
00:26:49,326 --> 00:26:52,329
行政办公室
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

386
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:01,880
哇！
Wow!

387
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:05,091
多么漂亮。这太完美了！
How nice. This is perfect!

388
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:08,595
现在我有了新大三学生，好事正在发生。
Great things are happening now that I have a new junior.

389
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,973
现在，CT外科医生正在接管多尔达姆医院。
Now, CT surgeons are taking over Doldam Hospital.

390
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,225
让我们扫一扫吧，好吗？
Let's sweep the board, okay?

391
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:17,020
我缺乏实践经验。我还有很多东西要学。
I'm lacking in practical experience. I have a lot to learn.

392
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,607
别担心。别紧张。
Don't worry. Don't be nervous.

393
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,651
如果你有任何问题，可以随时问我。
If you have any questions, ask me anytime.

394
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,277
如果您需要任何帮助，请寻求帮助。
And if you need any help, ask for it.

395
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:29,324
你很快就会明白，但是 Doldam 的每个人都很好。
You'll catch on soon enough, but everyone here at Doldam is nice.

396
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:31,535
好吧...
Well…

397
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:35,205
当心 GS 中的杨浩俊博士。他没那么好。
Just watch out for Dr. Yang Hojun in GS. He's not that great.

398
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:43,797
顺便问一下，为什么有三张办公桌？
By the way, why are there three desks?

399
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,048
哦...
Oh…

400
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:46,758
我不确定。
I'm not sure.

401
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,094
没办法。
No way.

402
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:54,015
凭借他的技能和名字价值，这并非不可能。
With his skills and his name value, it's not out of the question.

403
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:58,144
事实上，我们从中受益匪浅，吴女士。
In fact, we're gaining a lot from this, Ms. Oh.

404
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:02,257
是朴局长又在做吗？
Is it Director Park's doing again?

405
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,401
确实如此，对吧？他强迫你这样做。
It is, right? He pressured you into this.

406
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:07,445
天哪。不，不是。
Gosh. No, it isn't.

407
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:10,323
这次他说什么是为了走自己的路？
What did he say this time to get his own way?

408
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:13,451
他有没有利用开场日期来对付你？还是紧急直升机？
Did he use the opening date against you? Or the emergency helicopter?

409
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,370
他用了什么样的借口
What kind of excuse did he use

410
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:17,453
偷走创伤中心负责人的位置？
to steal the position of head of the Trauma Center?

411
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,875
我不是从他那里偷的，吴女士。
I didn't steal it from him, Ms. Oh.

412
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,837
我从外面听见你的声音。
I heard your voice from outside.

413
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:26,461
我不是故意的，但我无意中听见了你的谈话。
I didn't mean to, but I overheard your conversation.

414
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:28,091
我很高兴你已经听见我说话了。
I'm glad you already heard me.

415
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:31,761
亲自告诉我。
Tell me in person.

416
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,888
你在隐瞒什么样的阴谋
What kind of plot are you hiding

417
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:36,433
这个荒谬的人事任命的背后？
behind this ridiculous personnel appointment?

418
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:37,976
没有情节。
There is no plot.

419
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:39,894
我很生气，吴女士。
I'm upset, Ms. Oh.

420
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:43,648
在过去的三年中，我一直以忠诚和真诚的态度工作。
I've been working with loyalty and sincerity over the past three years.

421
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:46,651
把它称为忠诚和真诚的决定难道不是太荒谬了吗？
Isn't this too absurd of a decision to call it loyalty and sincerity?

422
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:49,395
你怎么能在万物的这种立场下做到这一点？
How could you do that with that position of all things?

423
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:53,158
你是如何发展这种随机而毫无意义的创造力的？
How do you develop such random and senseless creativity?

424
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:56,202
我告诉过你这是我的主意。
I told you it was my idea.

425
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:58,872
我就是这个意思！这是金大师的主意...
That's what I mean! It was Master Kim's idea…

426
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:04,085
-什么？-我说过我们应该这么做。
- What? - I said we should do it.

427
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:06,379
-但是...-MINGUK：看。
- But… - MINGUK: Look.

428
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:08,143
稍后让我们澄清误会。
Let's clear up the misunderstanding later.

429
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:10,300
我们现在去我的办公室吧。
Let's go up to my office for now.

430
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:14,054
查金满教授刚到。
Professor Cha Jinman just arrived.

431
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,223
我们开始做吧。
Let's do that.

432
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,935
稍后。
Later.

433
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:23,229
-我们待会儿再谈，吴女士。-但是...
- Let's talk later, Ms. Oh. - But…

434
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,400
-我们走吧。-好吧。
- Let's go. - Okay.

435
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:31,988
但是为什么？
But why?

436
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:34,574
为什么在地球上？
Why on earth?

437
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:42,082
那我就让你说话。
Then I'll leave you to talk.

438
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,924
我很感激你来到这里，查教授。
I'm so grateful to have you here, Professor Cha.

439
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:52,007
欢迎。
Welcome.

440
00:29:58,682 --> 00:29:59,599
这里。
Here.

441
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:02,811
我已经想出了一份加入创伤中心的医生名单。
I've come up with a list of doctors to join the Trauma Center.

442
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:03,978
啊，是的。
Ah, yes.

443
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:07,982
他们中的一些人给了我积极的回应。
A few of them have given me positive responses.

444
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:11,981
多尔达姆医院创伤中心推荐医生名单
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER RECOMMENDED DOCTOR LIST

445
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:16,658
多尔达姆的外科医生不在这里。
The Doldam surgeons aren't on here.

446
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:21,538
我还没能确认他们的技能。
I haven't been able to confirm their skills yet.

447
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:24,666
你不必担心。
You don't have to worry about that.

448
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:28,378
多尔达姆外科医生的专长是治疗创伤患者。
The Doldam surgeons' specialty is treating trauma patients.

449
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:30,880
金大师把注意力集中在那个领域
Master Kim has focused on that area

450
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:33,550
并训练他们成为一支优秀的团队。
and trained them to be a good team.

451
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:34,633
朴导演
Director Park.

452
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:37,345
我对人的评判标准
My standards of judging people

453
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:40,223
和卜勇珠的完全不同。
is quite different from Bu Yongju's.

454
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:44,269
我的教学风格也应该有很大的不同。
My style of teaching should differ greatly as well.

455
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:45,895
没办法。
No way.

456
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:50,233
你的意思不是因为我你会把外科医生排除在Doldam之外，对吧？
You don't mean you will exclude surgeons from Doldam because of me, right?

457
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,319
我的意思是我们不能给多尔达姆外科医生任何特殊待遇。
I mean we can't give Doldam surgeons any special treatment.

458
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,072
该中心依靠政府资金运作。
This center runs on government funding.

459
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:58,283
规则必须公平。
The rules must be fair.

460
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:01,578
此外，技能在治疗创伤方面可能很重要，
Besides, skill may be important in treating trauma,

461
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:04,122
但团队合作也是如此。
but so is teamwork.

462
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,915
你说过你会根据技能做出公平的判断。
You said you'd judge fairly based on skill.

463
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:09,753
但在我看来，你会有非常个人化的标准。
But it sounds to me that you will have very personal standards.

464
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:15,383
老实说，很明显，如果他们向你学习，他们会是什么样子。
To be honest, it's obvious how they'd be if they learned from you.

465
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:18,303
他们会鲁莽，粗鲁无理，
They will be reckless, insolent,

466
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,389
或者出于傲慢而乐于使用手术刀。
or happy to wield a scalpel out of arrogance.

467
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:22,599
像这样的人。
People like that.

468
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:24,100
你喜欢这样的孩子。
You like kids like that.

469
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:28,646
我偏爱那些为患者尽其所能的医生。
I do favor doctors who do what they must for patients.

470
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,317
而且，如果他们的手牌很好，那就更好了。
And if they have good hands, even better.

471
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,195
一只好手并不总是能成为好医生。
A good hand doesn't always make a good doctor.

472
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:36,362
没错。
Exactly.

473
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,200
就像考试成绩好也不能造就好医生一样。
Just like how good test scores don't make good doctors either.

474
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:51,544
好吧...
Well…

475
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:55,423
我认为我们现在无法就人事问题做出决定。
I don't think we can decide on personnel matters right now.

476
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,258
你这么自信吗？
Are you so confident?

477
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:04,891
如果我没有信心
If I weren't confident,

478
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,851
我会安排这个会议吗？
would I have set up this meeting?

479
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:10,355
我敢肯定你知道我的标准
I'm sure you know that my standards

480
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:12,982
非常挑剔和保守。
are very picky and conservative.

481
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:16,569
我确实记得你心胸狭窄、固执的天性使我感到沮丧。
I do remember that you frustrated me with your narrow-minded and stubborn nature.

482
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:21,658
好吧，距离创伤中心开业还有一段时间。
Well, we still have some time until the Trauma Center opens.

483
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:23,034
所以，在适当的时候...
So, in due time…

484
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:24,327
那我们开始做吧。
Let's do it, then.

485
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,080
让我们看看多尔达姆的外科医生有多出色。
Let's see how good Doldam's surgeons are.

486
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,541
如果你自己动手会更好。
It would be better if you operate yourself.

487
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:33,670
我想看看你这么久以来有多出色。
I want to see how good you are since it's been so long.

488
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:38,508
我想知道这些年来你的技能提高了多少。
I wonder how much your skills have improved over the years.

489
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:40,802
-你没喝这个，对吧？-金大师
- You're not drinking this, are you? - Master Kim.

490
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:43,429
我想知道
I wonder

491
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:46,015
如果你生锈了。
if you've gotten rusty at all.

492
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:00,405
让我们在适当的时候讨论人事问题。
Let's discuss personnel matters in due time.

493
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:03,116
我给你看你要使用的房间，查教授。
I'll show you the room that you will be using, Professor Cha.

494
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:05,535
房间？
Room?

495
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:09,497
我会给你指路。
I'll show you the way.

496
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:11,415
我们走吧。
Let's go.

497
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,002
查教授？
Professor Cha?

498
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:26,890
你真的会没事吗？
Will you really be okay?

499
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,473
别问。
Don't ask.

500
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:33,104
我对这个决定后悔了大约三秒钟。
I was just regretting this decision for about three seconds.

501
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:36,482
他还没签合同。
He hasn't signed the contract yet.

502
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:38,943
现在告诉我你是否改变主意还为时不晚。
It's not too late to tell me if you've changed your mind.

503
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:43,990
我们甚至无法在开门之前结束事情。
We can't end things before we even open the door.

504
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:47,285
那么最终，你真的会进入这扇狭窄的门吗？
So ultimately, you really will enter this narrow door?

505
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:48,620
如果你拿起一把剑
If you pick up a sword,

506
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:51,456
你至少能做的就是解开它的护套。
the least you can do is unsheathe it.

507
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,707
好吧。
Okay.

508
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,711
记住。那是我给你的最后一次机会。
Remember. That was the last chance I gave you.

509
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,772
当我第一次在创伤中心见到你的时候
When I first saw you in the Trauma Center,

510
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:16,940
你就像复仇者联盟。
you were like the Avengers.

511
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:18,942
-说真的。-复仇者联盟？别恭维我。
- Seriously. - The Avengers? Don't flatter me.

512
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:21,110
无论如何，我很荣幸能和你一起工作。
Anyway, I'm honored to work with you.

513
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:22,028
荣幸？
Honored?

514
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:24,197
李博士，你用了这么甜言蜜语。你很荣幸。
Dr. Lee, you use such sweet words. You're honored.

515
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,865
我真的觉得你给人留下了深刻的印象。
I really think you're impressive.

516
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:29,410
完全可以理解。我知道我们的外科医生给人留下了深刻的印象。
Totally understandable. I know we surgeons are pretty impressive.

517
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,870
嗯！
Mmm!

518
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:34,457
李博士，你是我们的幸运符。
Dr. Lee, you're our lucky charm.

519
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:36,584
这是你自己混的吗？天哪。
Did you blend this yourself? Gosh.

520
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:38,753
我没成功，但很不错，对吧？
I didn't make it, but it's good, right?

521
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:39,879
嗯！
Mmm!

522
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,844
这是什么，徐博士？
What is it, Dr. Seo?

523
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:48,972
这是 CS 房间。在你进来之前敲门。
This is the CS room. Knock before you come in.

524
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:57,063
李博士
Dr. Lee.

525
00:34:57,605 --> 00:34:59,107
你去过急诊室吗？
Have you been to the ER yet?

526
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:02,360
你想环顾四周向急诊室的人打个招呼吗？
Do you want to look around and say hi to the ER folks?

527
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,450
为什么？你有什么要跟我说的吗，徐博士？
Why? Do you have something to tell me, Dr. Seo?

528
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:11,869
你不觉得你有话要跟我说吗，查博士？
Don't you think you have something to tell me, Dr. Cha?

529
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:14,455
稍后。
Later.

530
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:16,916
我们待会儿再谈。
Let's talk later.

531
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:20,753
我现在和李博士有关系。
I have something to do with Dr. Lee right now.

532
00:35:20,837 --> 00:35:23,131
李博士，你能给我们一会儿房间吗？
Dr. Lee, could you give us the room for a moment?

533
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:24,979
我有事要和查博士讨论。
I have something to discuss with Dr. Cha.

534
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:26,384
是的，当然。
Yes, of course.

535
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,467
不，李博士！
No, Dr. Lee!

536
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:30,430
-没必要离开。-好吧。
- There's no need to leave. - Okay.

537
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:31,889
我只需要五分钟，李博士。
I just need five minutes, Dr. Lee.

538
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:33,725
哦，好吧。
Oh, okay.

539
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:36,019
李博士，你只需要听另一位 CT 外科医生的话。
Dr. Lee, you only need to listen to a fellow CT surgeon.

540
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:38,145
李博士
Dr. Lee.

541
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,357
来吧，我敢肯定你听错了。
Come on, I'm sure you misheard something.

542
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:26,569
所有地方的创伤中心？那个地方是金大师的...
The Trauma Center of all places? That place is Master Kim's...

543
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,488
我从金大师本人那里听到的。
I heard it from Master Kim himself.

544
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:30,990
我知道。所以，主人... 什么？
I know. So Master… What?

545
00:36:31,074 --> 00:36:33,242
他为什么突然做出这个决定？
Why did he make that decision all of a sudden?

546
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:36,037
如果朴局长没有向他施压
If Director Park didn't pressure him,

547
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,456
他自己做出了这个决定，
and he made this decision himself,

548
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:40,625
这更像是个谜。
it's even more of a mystery.

549
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,709
也许，
Perhaps,

550
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,260
可能是因为他的多发性硬化症吗？
could it be because of his multiple sclerosis?

551
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,050
他的症状可能在我们不知情的情况下变得更糟了。
His symptoms might have gotten worse without our knowing.

552
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:51,636
来吧，没办法。
Come on, there's no way.

553
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,971
他在休息日去钓鱼，
He's been going fishing on his days off,

554
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:56,349
呼吸充足的新鲜空气和锻炼身体。
getting plenty of fresh air and exercise.

555
00:36:56,432 --> 00:36:58,726
他一直在努力保持健康。
He's been working hard to keep up his health.

556
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,188
对，上个月我们做了一些血液检查和其他检查时，
Right, when we did some bloodwork and a few other tests last month,

557
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:03,648
他所有的结果都还不错。
all his results were okay.

558
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:06,484
对，我怀疑是这样，吴女士。
Right, I doubt that's what it is, Ms. Oh.

559
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:10,822
如果不是这样，我就是根本不明白。
If that's not it, I just don't understand it at all.

560
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,802
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

561
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,102
我需要一个解释，先生。
I need an explanation, sir.

562
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:42,686
什么？
What?

563
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:53,822
天哪。
Gosh.

564
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:00,663
首先，金大师。
First of all, Master Kim.

565
00:38:01,164 --> 00:38:03,332
查金曼是创伤中心主任？
Cha Jinman as head of the Trauma Center?

566
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,626
有吗
Is there

567
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,462
我们不知道的其他原因？
some other reason that we don't know of?

568
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:12,967
如果不是，我就是不明白。
If not, I just don't get it.

569
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,468
不，吴女士。
No, Ms. Oh.

570
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:18,973
这个职位应该向任何有能力的人开放，
That position should be open to anyone capable,

571
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:22,059
即使那不是我。
even if that isn't me.

572
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,313
说你听不懂
Saying that you can't understand that

573
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:28,274
是一个危险的想法。
is a dangerous thought.

574
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:31,986
我知道。
I know.

575
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,490
我们都在为创伤中心努力工作。
We've all been working very hard for the Trauma Center.

576
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,702
而且，如果不是你的努力和奉献精神，
And if not for your efforts and dedication,

577
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,621
我们不会走这么远。
we wouldn't have gotten this far.

578
00:38:41,704 --> 00:38:45,249
但是努力和奉献精神
But effort and dedication

579
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,793
应该在你给他们的那一刻就被抛在后面。
should be left behind the moment you've given them.

580
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:50,171
希望能得到某种形式的付款
Hoping for some kind of payment

581
00:38:50,254 --> 00:38:52,215
或者要求认可你的输入，
or demanding recognition of your input,

582
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:56,302
事情会瞬间变成一团混乱。
things will turn into a muddy mess in a flash.

583
00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:57,886
但是，
But,

584
00:38:58,221 --> 00:39:02,266
创伤中心的负责人应该是负责的领导者。
the head of the Trauma Center should be the leader who will take charge.

585
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,685
这个职位应该填补
That position should be filled

586
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,688
经过更仔细的考虑。
after more careful and meticulous consideration.

587
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,405
如果你们都继续努力
If all of you keep working hard

588
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,699
在你各自的位置上
in your respective positions,

589
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:22,370
仅仅因为我们雇了人就不会发生任何激烈的事情
nothing drastic will happen just because we hired someone

590
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:25,248
从外面看来是创伤中心的新主任
from the outside to be the new head of the Trauma Center.

591
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:28,833
我的天哪。
My goodness.

592
00:39:29,377 --> 00:39:30,711
我知道。
I know.

593
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:34,924
这对我们来说也将是一次考验。
This will be a test for us too.

594
00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:36,007
但是，
However,

595
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:41,097
一旦开业我们就会有更多的创伤病人
we will have more trauma patients once we open,

596
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,433
那我们就需要更多的医生。
then we'll need more doctors.

597
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,561
如果不接受新医生，
Without accepting new doctors,

598
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,398
你认为我们还能坚持多久？
how much longer do you think we can hold out?

599
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:54,235
所以拜托，
So please,

600
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:56,988
毫无偏见地接受我的决定。
accept my decision without any bias.

601
00:39:58,072 --> 00:39:59,657
好吧，吴女士？
Okay, Ms. Oh?

602
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,370
土壤。
Doil.

603
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:16,716
张局长和裴博士也是
Chief Jang and Dr. Bae too.

604
00:40:20,678 --> 00:40:21,554
好吧。
Okay.

605
00:40:21,637 --> 00:40:24,223
郑博士和恩达也是。
Dr. Jung and Euntak too.

606
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:29,687
你呢，徐宇镇博士？
And you, Dr. Seo Woojin?

607
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,280
发生了什么事？
What's going on?

608
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:44,618
在创伤中心准备好之前我会和你共用这个办公室。
I'll be sharing this office with you until the Trauma Center is ready.

609
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:48,414
我在问你为什么来多尔达姆医院。
I'm asking why you came to Doldam Hospital.

610
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:51,268
朴主任给了我创伤中心主任的职位
Director Park offered me the position of the head of the Trauma Center,

611
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,960
我接受了。
and I accepted.

612
00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:54,045
爸爸！
Dad!

613
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:57,673
你可以在医院叫我爸爸吗？
Is it okay for you to call me Dad in the hospital?

614
00:40:57,757 --> 00:41:00,551
如果你是创伤中心的负责人，那金大师呢？
If you're the head of the Trauma Center, what about Master Kim?

615
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:04,889
我的意思是，你为什么辞去大学医院的工作？
I mean, why did you quit your job at the university hospital?

616
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:06,223
为了什么？
What for?

617
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:09,643
我从当今社会获得了很多特权。
I've received much privilege from today's society.

618
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,395
什么？
What?

619
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:15,149
多亏了这一点，我获得了荣誉并成为众人瞩目的焦点。
Thanks to that, I've received honor and been in the limelight.

620
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:18,194
现在是我还钱的时候了。
It's time for me to pay it back.

621
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:20,029
对于社会来说，
For society,

622
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:24,367
我打算从这里开始承担责任并履行职责。
I intend to take on responsibility and perform my duties from here.

623
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,911
-爸爸。-最重要的是，
- Dad. - And most of all,

624
00:41:26,994 --> 00:41:28,496
我也想见你。
I wanted to see you too.

625
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,510
对不起，先生，
I'm sorry, sir,

626
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:47,181
但这次我不同意你的决定。
but I can't agree with your decision this time.

627
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,601
为什么不呢？你还需要更多的解释吗？
Why not? Do you still need more of an explanation?

628
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:55,106
不，你说的一切我都明白。
No, I understood everything you said.

629
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:57,817
我只是...
I just…

630
00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:00,694
我不同意。仅此而已。
can't agree with it. That's all.

631
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:03,322
我告诉过你了。你没必要那样保持警惕。
I told you. You don't need to keep your guard up like that.

632
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:06,617
查金满教授是一位才华横溢的外科医生，在该领域拥有丰富的经验。
Professor Cha Jinman is a talented surgeon who has experience in the field.

633
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,952
有了这个机会，
And with this opportunity,

634
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,081
从局外人那里得到客观的评估并不是一个坏主意。
it won't be a bad idea to get an objective evaluation from an outsider.

635
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:14,708
你是唯一能评价我作为医生的人。
You're the only one who can evaluate me as a doctor.

636
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:18,712
你也是我唯一想被认可为医生的人。
You're also the only one I want to be recognized by as a doctor.

637
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:21,757
嘿，宇镇。
Hey, Woojin.

638
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:24,343
没有你我就不想要创伤中心。
I don't want a trauma center without you.

639
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:29,348
如果你决定待在这里
If you decide to stay here,

640
00:42:30,474 --> 00:42:31,725
我也会。
I will too.

641
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:55,332
我们能聊一会吗？
Can we talk for a minute?

642
00:43:01,714 --> 00:43:02,715
所以...
So…

643
00:43:03,424 --> 00:43:06,594
我爸要来多尔达姆医院了
My dad will be coming to Doldam Hospital.

644
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:09,096
我收到金大师的来信。
I heard from Master Kim.

645
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:11,974
哦，我明白了。
Oh, I see.

646
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:16,729
这是什么？
What is it?

647
00:43:16,812 --> 00:43:18,230
嗯？
Hm?

648
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:21,317
你有话想对我说。告诉我。
You have something you want to say to me. Tell me.

649
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,320
好吧，问题是...
Well, the thing is…

650
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:32,578
我爸说他还没找到住的地方所以...
My dad says he hasn't found a place to stay yet, so…

651
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:38,250
对不起，我们该怎么做？
Sorry, what do we do?

652
00:43:39,376 --> 00:43:41,629
那我所有的东西呢？
What about all my stuff?

653
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:45,591
我们还没把它们拆开，所以它们还在箱子里。
We haven't unpacked them, so they're still in boxes.

654
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:49,762
如果我说我有室友，他就不会进入你的房间。
If I say that I have a roommate, he won't go into your room.

655
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:54,558
你能不能待在别的地方等他过几天才找到地方？
Could you please stay somewhere else until he finds a place in a few days?

656
00:43:56,894 --> 00:44:00,731
我调查了一下，但公司住房已经满了。
I looked into it, but company housing is already full.

657
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,317
他说他会睡在旅馆里，
He said he would sleep at an inn,

658
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:05,819
但他必须一路走进城里。
but he'd have to go all the way into town.

659
00:44:08,197 --> 00:44:11,700
我已经有一年没有见到他了，所以我不放心。
I haven't seen him in a year, so I didn't feel at ease.

660
00:44:13,577 --> 00:44:15,955
好吧，我待在医院。
Okay, I'll stay at the hospital.

661
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:18,749
你没生气，对吧？
You're not mad, are you?

662
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,375
根本没有。
Not at all.

663
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:22,920
谢谢。
Thanks.

664
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:29,343
-恩宰。-是吗？
- Eunjae. - Yes?

665
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:30,970
他是你爸爸。
He's your dad.

666
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:32,888
而且我是你的男人。
And I'm your man.

667
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:38,811
你不必这么难问我，好吗？
It doesn't have to be so hard for you to ask me, okay?

668
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
好吧。
Okay.

669
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,109
别被抓住。
Don't get caught.

670
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:47,903
好吧，我不会。
Okay, I won't.

671
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,950
对不起番茄汁了。
Sorry about the tomato juice.

672
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:55,661
嘿，那个番茄汁...
Hey, that tomato juice…

673
00:44:58,622 --> 00:44:59,623
好吧。
Okay.

674
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:30,904
到了该死的医院帕克教授
ARRIVED AT DOLDAMN HOSPITAL PROFESSOR PARK

675
00:45:30,988 --> 00:45:34,867
一般来说，把它记得很重要。
Generally speaking, it's important to make it down well.

676
00:45:38,996 --> 00:45:40,331
但是这个叫做骄傲的该死的东西
But this darn thing called pride

677
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:43,709
让男人表现得小气。
makes a man act petty.

678
00:45:57,473 --> 00:45:59,558
-他为什么要那样做？-你在哪里？
- Why did he do that? - Where are you?

679
00:45:59,642 --> 00:46:01,769
-他在想什么？-他在哪里？
- What was he thinking? - Where is he?

680
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:03,603
我们来了！
We're coming!

681
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:04,980
-快点！-Sungyoon！
- Hurry up! - Sungyoon!

682
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:07,441
-我觉得很严重。-快点。
- I think it's serious. - Hurry.

683
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:08,651
嘿，成云。
Hey, Sungyoon.

684
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,154
-你还好吗？-他的腿骨折了！
- Are you okay? - His leg is broken!

685
00:46:13,322 --> 00:46:14,448
这条路。
This way.

686
00:46:14,948 --> 00:46:16,075
-Sungyoon！-教练！
- Sungyoon! - Coach!

687
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,451
教练！
Coach!

688
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:20,704
-快点！-我们必须帮助他！
- Hurry up! - We have to help him!

689
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:22,247
-快点！-哦，不。
- Hurry! - Oh, no.

690
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,792
快点！教练！
Hurry! Coach!

691
00:46:29,213 --> 00:46:31,048
-耐心点。-嘿，你打了 911 吗？
- Endure it. - Hey, did you call 911?

692
00:46:34,218 --> 00:46:35,218
别碰他。
Don't touch him.

693
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:46,355
你好，我在这里。
Hello, I'm here.

694
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:48,606
呵呵？
Huh?

695
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,902
嘿，荣格博士。我在这里。
Hey, Dr. Jung. I'm here.

696
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:53,529
嘿，尹阿雷姆博士。
Hey, Dr. Yoon Areum.

697
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:56,531
那好吧。
All right then.

698
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,370
嗯？
Hm?

699
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,678
无论如何，这是金大师的决定。
Anyway, it was Master Kim's decision.

700
00:47:18,053 --> 00:47:20,222
查博士到底是什么样的人？
What kind of person is Dr. Cha exactly?

701
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:23,267
好吧，他在心胸外科领域相当出名。
Well, he was pretty well-known in cardiothoracic surgery.

702
00:47:32,985 --> 00:47:34,027
呵呵？
Huh?

703
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:37,740
尹博士你来得早。你今晚没待命吗？
Dr. Yoon. You're here early. Aren't you on call tonight?

704
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:41,452
我有一些论文要看。但是，裴博士。
I had some papers to look over. But, Dr. Bae.

705
00:47:42,286 --> 00:47:44,413
医院里的心情怎么样？
What's with the mood in the hospital?

706
00:47:45,456 --> 00:47:46,498
哦。
Oh.

707
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:51,503
天哪，金大师刚才引爆了一枚巨大的炸弹。
Gosh, Master Kim set off a massive bomb just now.

708
00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:56,632
五...
Five…

709
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:12,274
我能帮你什么忙吗？
Can I help you with anything?

710
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:13,650
你在这里。
You're here.

711
00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:15,235
我听说了。
I heard.

712
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:18,822
显然，金大师今天引爆了一枚核弹。
Apparently, Master Kim set off a nuclear bomb today.

713
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,741
我知道。
I know.

714
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,701
他做到了。
He did.

715
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:27,080
我们做什么？感觉就像每个人都在精神崩溃。
What do we do? It feels like everyone is having a mental breakdown.

716
00:48:28,248 --> 00:48:30,417
你还好吗，恩塔克？
Are you okay, Euntak?

717
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:32,920
这对我来说也是一种崩溃。
It was a breakdown for me too.

718
00:48:33,378 --> 00:48:35,130
但听了金大师的解释后
But after hearing Master Kim's explanation,

719
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,382
我明白他为什么要做他所做的事情。
I understood why he did what he did.

720
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,802
这始终是问题所在。
That's always the problem.

721
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,763
每当金大师引爆炸弹时
Whenever Master Kim sets off a bomb,

722
00:48:43,722 --> 00:48:46,683
你会想，“这有意义吗？”
you think, "Does this make any sense?"

723
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:49,603
但是当你听他说话时，你总能理解他。
But then when you hear him out, you always understand him.

724
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:54,191
你有没有时差呢？
Are you jet-lagged at all?

725
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,569
我很好。我在两天内就调整好了。
I'm fine. I adjusted within two days.

726
00:48:58,987 --> 00:48:59,987
哦，对。
Oh, right.

727
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:02,533
这里。
Here.

728
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:04,827
我在回来的路上在机场买的。
I bought it at the airport on my way back.

729
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,620
我错过了把它交给你的机会。
I missed the chance to give it to you.

730
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:15,963
因为你的手很珍贵。
Since your hands are precious.

731
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:21,510
我想念你。
I missed you.

732
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:24,096
我们只分开了一个星期。
We were only apart for a week.

733
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:25,681
但是你怎么能
But how could you

734
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:28,100
一次都没给我发过短信？
not even text me once?

735
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:32,187
你去偏远地区做义工。
You went to volunteer in a remote area.

736

“你什么时候回来？”

你会想，“这有意义吗？”

没时间留意张东华的心情。

00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:32,402
外送食物味道也不错。
Delivery food tastes good too.

890
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:34,414
没关系。别介意我。
It's fine. Don't mind me.

891
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:36,833
我不喜欢拉面。
I don't dislike ramyeon.

892
00:59:39,752 --> 00:59:40,920
嗯。
Mm.

893
00:59:46,259 --> 00:59:47,259
是医院吗？
Is it the hospital?

894
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,388
是的。他们认为这是一条腓骨动脉破裂。
Yes. They think it's a ruptured popliteal artery.

895
00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:51,681
开始吧。
Get going.

896
00:59:53,725 --> 00:59:56,436
完成后把碗放在水槽里即可。
Just leave the bowl in the sink when you're done.

897
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:58,688
-我回来的时候去洗碗。-好吧。
- I'll do the dishes when I get back. - Okay.

898
01:00:02,192 --> 01:00:04,486
手术可能会延迟，所以不要等。
The surgery might run late, so don't wait up.

899
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:06,237
好吧。
Okay.

900
01:00:48,404 --> 01:00:51,199
这是今天早上剩下的西红柿。喝酒前要摇匀。
IT'S THE TOMATOES LEFT FROM THIS MORNING. SHAKE WELL BEFORE DRINKING.

901
01:01:59,809 --> 01:02:00,809
女士更衣室
WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM

902
01:02:02,437 --> 01:02:04,063
嘿，李博士。你还在这里吗？
Hey, Dr. Lee. Are you still here?

903
01:02:04,647 --> 01:02:05,648
你要回家吗？
Are you going home?

904
01:02:05,732 --> 01:02:08,860
我回家后回来做紧急手术。
I went home and came back for an emergency surgery.

905
01:02:08,943 --> 01:02:10,320
紧急手术？
An emergency surgery?

906
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:14,741
我也可以去手术室吗？
May I also go into the OR?

907
01:02:17,368 --> 01:02:18,202
这是什么？
What is it?

908
01:02:18,286 --> 01:02:21,205
你能有多幸运？天哪。
How lucky can you get? Gosh.

909
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:23,541
这种稀有物到底来自哪里？
Where on earth did this rarity come from?

910
01:02:24,042 --> 01:02:25,376
快点做好准备。
Hurry up and get ready.

911
01:02:26,085 --> 01:02:27,962
今天我来教你一堂课。
I'll teach you a lesson today.

912
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:49,651
禁区手术室
RESTRICTED AREA OPERATING ROOM

913
01:03:03,915 --> 01:03:05,625
CT 扫描似乎显示损坏
The CT scan seems to show damage

914
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,388
在胫前动脉和后动脉中
in the anterior and posterior tibial artery

915
01:03:07,543 --> 01:03:09,743
在远端区域而不是腓骨动脉。
in the distalis region rather than the popliteal artery.

916
01:03:10,546 --> 01:03:12,382
我们必须做一些探索，
We'll have to do some exploring,

917
01:03:12,465 --> 01:03:14,842
但从我穿夹板时看到的情况来看，
but from what I saw while putting on the splints,

918
01:03:15,635 --> 01:03:17,470
这似乎是腓骨的深层神经。
it seems to be the deep peroneal nerve.

919
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:22,737
恩宰，那动脉吻合术呢？
Eunjae, what about the artery anastomosis?

920
01:03:22,809 --> 01:03:24,602
周围有很多组织损伤，
There's a lot of tissue damage around it,

921
01:03:24,686 --> 01:03:27,105
所以我正在考虑从另一侧移植GSV。
so I'm considering a GSV graft from the other side.

922
01:03:27,188 --> 01:03:28,940
为了预防隔室综合症，
In order to prevent compartment syndrome,

923
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,359
Munjeong 也在考虑做筋膜切开术。
Munjeong is considering a fasciotomy as well.

924
01:03:31,442 --> 01:03:33,194
你会怎么处理腓骨神经？
What will you do about the peroneal nerve?

925
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:38,616
纱布。
Gauze.

926
01:03:43,496 --> 01:03:44,831
好吧。Bovie。
Okay. Bovie.

927
01:03:51,796 --> 01:03:52,796
等着这里。
Hold here.

928
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:54,340
镊子。
Forceps.

929
01:03:56,718 --> 01:03:57,927
Metzenbaum 剪刀。
Metzenbaum scissors.

930
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,433
对不起，先生。
Sorry, sir.

931
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:10,565
去除脾脏。
Remove the spleen.

932
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:17,113
请用纱布。
Gauze, please.

933
01:04:23,035 --> 01:04:24,203
缝合。
Suture.

934
01:04:33,171 --> 01:04:34,380
让金大师上线
Get Master Kim on the line.

935
01:04:38,926 --> 01:04:40,303
大师，
Master,

936
01:04:40,386 --> 01:04:41,763
我们将在五分钟内完成缝合。
we'll finish suturing in five.

937
01:04:42,472 --> 01:04:43,752
我们会从 neurorhaphy 开始吗？
Will we start with neurorrhaphy?

938
01:04:43,806 --> 01:04:45,850
你在说什么？动脉是第一位的。
What are you saying? The arteries come first.

939
01:04:45,933 --> 01:04:47,268
他是国家队的一员。
He's on the national team.

940
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:50,813
如果我们不尽快消除紧张情绪，他可能再也不会跳下去了。
If we don't stitch up the nerves soon, he might never get to jump again.

941
01:04:50,897 --> 01:04:54,567
如果我们不尽快找到他的动脉，他可能会失去整条腿。
If we don't get to his arteries soon, he might lose his whole leg.

942
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:56,151
大师。
Master.

943
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:05,869
大师。
Master.

944
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,215
切。
Cut.

945
01:05:18,007 --> 01:05:20,009
张东华，你做闭合缝合。
Jang Donghwa, you do the closing sutures.

946
01:05:20,092 --> 01:05:21,092
三分钟之内。
Within three minutes.

947
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:26,974
张博士
Dr. Jang.

948
01:05:33,022 --> 01:05:34,023
把它交给我。
Give it to me.

949
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:36,859
大师。
Master.

950
01:05:36,943 --> 01:05:38,569
我们不能先做神经疗法吗？
Can't we do the neurorrhaphy first?

951
01:05:39,153 --> 01:05:40,154
徐宇镇.
Seo Woojin.

952
01:05:40,238 --> 01:05:42,883
如此严重的骨折意味着受伤部位的末端被压碎。
A fracture this serious means the end of the injury site is crushed.

953
01:05:42,907 --> 01:05:45,201
即使你在探索之后做了神经外科手术，
Even if you do a neurorrhaphy after exploring,

954
01:05:45,284 --> 01:05:48,371
可行性太低了。我们不能延迟动脉吻合术。
the viability is too low. We can't delay the artery anastomosis.

955
01:05:48,454 --> 01:05:50,289
如果他不能从神经损伤中恢复过来
If he doesn't recover from the nerve injury,

956
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:52,208
无论如何，他作为运动员的生活已经结束了。
his life as an athlete is over anyway.

957
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,460
不管怎样，对那个人来说都是死刑。
Either way, it's a death sentence for that man.

958
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:57,004
尽管如此，与其冒险，
Still, rather than taking a risk,

959
01:05:57,088 --> 01:05:59,632
我认为先做动脉手术是正确的，徐博士。
I think it's right to do the arterial surgery first, Dr. Seo.

960
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:02,885
神经在受伤的那一刻就开始死亡。
Nerves start to die the moment they sustain an injury.

961
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:05,409
那不是最好尽快把它们缝回去吗？
Then isn't it best to stitch them back up as soon as possible?

962
01:06:06,222 --> 01:06:09,100
金大师以你的速度，这是可能的。
Master Kim. With your speed, it's possible.

963
01:06:14,856 --> 01:06:16,023
大师。
Master.

964
01:06:16,524 --> 01:06:18,734
你为什么犹豫不决？
Why are you hesitating?

965
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:20,318
嗯？
Hm?

966
01:06:22,613 --> 01:06:24,740
所有手术都必须优先考虑患者的生命。
All surgeries must prioritize the patient's life.

967
01:06:24,824 --> 01:06:26,158
其次是患者的安全。
Next is the patient's safety.

968
01:06:26,868 --> 01:06:29,078
关于功能的决定排在最后。
Decisions on function come last.

969
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:32,039
这里的每个人都知道。
Everyone in here knows that.

970
01:06:32,123 --> 01:06:33,416
那你为什么要浪费时间？
So why are you wasting time?

971
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:36,210
你没在想
You're not thinking

972
01:06:37,295 --> 01:06:40,256
像疯子一样先做神经疗法，对吗？
of doing a neurorrhaphy first like a madman, are you?

973
01:06:40,339 --> 01:06:44,385
我们正在考虑哪种方法对这位患者来说是最好的方法。
We're contemplating what would be the best method for this patient.

974
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:46,345
那你为什么要考虑这个呢？
So why are you contemplating that?

975
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,181
救他的命令已经确定了。
The order to save him is already set.

976
01:06:49,265 --> 01:06:50,474
对那个病人来说
To that patient,

977
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:53,477
他作为运动员的生活也危在旦夕。
his life as an athlete is also on the line.

978
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:56,290
如果你错过了手术时机，他将失去运动员的生命
If you miss the timing to operate, he will lose his life as an athlete

979
01:06:56,314 --> 01:06:57,148
还有他的腿。
as well as his leg.

980
01:06:57,231 --> 01:07:00,276
或者，他可能不会输任何一个。
Or, he might not lose either one.

981
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,783
好吧，吴女士。
All right, Ms. Oh.

982
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:10,328
你能检查一下病人左脚的肤色吗？
Could you check the complexion of the patient's left foot?

983
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:23,799
看起来不错，金大师。
It's looking good, Master Kim.

984
01:07:28,262 --> 01:07:31,599
宇镇。你还需要多久才能完成关闭？
Woojin. How much longer do you need to finish closing?

985
01:07:32,892 --> 01:07:34,101
张东华博士
Dr. Jang Donghwa.

986
01:07:36,896 --> 01:07:37,896
我受够了。
I'm done.

987
01:07:38,814 --> 01:07:40,066
-切。-切。
- Cut. - Cut.

988
01:07:41,692 --> 01:07:43,361
我们结束关门了，金大师。
We're done closing, Master Kim.

989
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:46,572
我们先做动脉吗？还是 neurorrhaphy？
Are we doing the arteries first? Or the neurorrhaphy?

990
01:07:59,168 --> 01:08:00,252
先是 Neurorhaphy。
Neurorrhaphy first.

991
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,465
好吧，首先是神经疗法。
Okay, the neurorrhaphy first.

992
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:06,592
你不应该从患者的角度来看待。
You shouldn't look at the patient's perspective.

993
01:08:09,929 --> 01:08:12,223
你必须看看症状，卜博士。
You must look at the symptoms, Dr. Bu.

994
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:15,601
这就是为什么我刚才检查了他的症状。
That's why I just checked his symptoms.

995
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:18,729
你没听见他左脚的肤色又回来了吗？
Didn't you hear the complexion in his left foot is back?

996
01:08:18,813 --> 01:08:19,939
那意味着
That means

997
01:08:20,022 --> 01:08:24,568
两条动脉有一条没有受损。那意味着
one of the two arteries hasn't been damaged. And that means

998
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:29,323
先紧张情绪不会有太大的风险。
it won't be too much of a risk to stitch up the nerves first.

999
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:32,827
别这么业余。
Don't be such an amateur.

1000
01:08:35,371 --> 01:08:36,371
你生锈了吗？
Are you getting rusty?

1001
01:08:39,959 --> 01:08:42,003
天哪，他什么都知道。
Gosh, he knows everything.

1002
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:44,046
他甚至有这个想法。
He even had that in mind.

1003
01:08:45,548 --> 01:08:46,590
我们进去吧，查博士。
Let's go in, Dr. Cha.

1004
01:08:48,426 --> 01:08:49,593
哦，好吧。
Oh, okay.

1005
01:08:49,677 --> 01:08:50,761
车恩才，
Cha Eunjae,

1006
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:54,098
你是说你会去做那个手术吗？
are you saying you will go into that surgery?

1007
01:08:54,682 --> 01:08:55,516
什么？
What?

1008
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:58,936
你会参加那种冲动和鲁莽的手术吗？
You will participate in that impulsive and reckless surgery?

1009
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,312
这不是鲁莽的。
It's not reckless.

1010
01:09:00,813 --> 01:09:03,190
他看见了我们看不见的东西。
He sees what we can't see.

1011
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:06,110
金大师在处理创伤方面有丰富的经验。
Master Kim has a lot of experience dealing with trauma.

1012
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:07,194
是的，没错。
Yes, that's right.

1013
01:09:10,197 --> 01:09:11,365
不管是谁，
Whoever it is,

1014
01:09:12,116 --> 01:09:14,910
不管他做什么或者他处于什么职位
no matter what he does or what position he is in,

1015
01:09:15,745 --> 01:09:17,288
他什么也没想。
he doesn't think about anything else.

1016
01:09:18,497 --> 01:09:20,499
他只记住一件事。
He just keeps one thing in mind.

1017
01:09:21,459 --> 01:09:22,460
救病人。
Save the patient.

1018
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:24,795
无论如何都要救病人。
Save the patient, no matter what.

1019
01:09:26,589 --> 01:09:30,801
那是金大师教给我们的第一堂课。
That was Master Kim's first lesson that he taught us.

1020
01:09:30,885 --> 01:09:35,181
你认为这是拯救一个人生命的手术吗？
Do you think that's a surgery to save a person's life?

1021
01:09:35,264 --> 01:09:36,849
对于那个病人来说
For that patient,

1022
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,061
他作为运动员的生活是他生活的一部分。
his life as an athlete is a part of his life.

1023
01:09:41,771 --> 01:09:42,813
你们...
You guys…

1024
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:46,275
和他一样疯狂。
are just as crazy as he is.

1025
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:51,447
有时候，有些关卡你不发疯就无法达到。
Sometimes, there are levels that you can't reach without going crazy.

1026
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:53,783
还有金大师...
And Master Kim…

1027
01:09:58,579 --> 01:09:59,830
称之为浪漫。
calls it romance.

1028
01:10:01,582 --> 01:10:02,583
浪漫？
Romance?

1029
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:06,045
在一个危及人们生命的领域
In a field where people's lives are at stake,

1030
01:10:06,462 --> 01:10:07,755
他在谈论寻找爱情？
he talks about finding romance?

1031
01:10:07,838 --> 01:10:08,838
是的。
Yes.

1032
01:10:09,799 --> 01:10:14,261
到目前为止，我们就是这样救人的，教授。
That's how we've been saving people up until now, Professor.

1033
01:10:20,643 --> 01:10:22,770
车恩宰，你不去吗？
Cha Eunjae, aren't you going?

1034
01:10:23,354 --> 01:10:24,355
如果没有，我就去。
If not, I'll go.

1035
01:10:30,194 --> 01:10:31,862
爸爸，我们待会儿再谈。
Dad, let's talk later.

1036
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:35,740
宇镇。
Woojin.

1037
01:11:13,904 --> 01:11:14,904
浪漫？
