00:01:57,002 --> 00:02:01,923
本剧中的人物、地点、组织和事件均为虚构的作品
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:16,229
一般来说，重要的是要把它做得很好。
Generally speaking,
it's important to make it down well.

4
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:18,982
但这个该死的东西叫作自豪感
But this darn thing called pride

5
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,901
使得一个人表现得很小气。
makes a man act petty.

6
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:23,862
看得远一点，明白吗？
Look far ahead, got it?

7
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:26,281
- 还有......--如果你反正要下去、
- Also…
- If you're going down anyway,

8
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:29,701
你可能会觉得这样做很酷。...放轻松一点
you might as well look cool doing it.
…loosen up a little!

9
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:31,202
戴上你的护目镜!
Put your goggles on!

10
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:35,707
但贪婪和傲慢使你如此努力。
But greed and arrogance
make you try so hard.

11
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,251
- 只有在你变成残骸之后......--明白吗？
- Only after you become a wreck…
- Got it?

12
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:42,088
......你是否最终能够放下它。
…will you finally be able
to let it go.

13
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,391
这个风...
This wind…

14
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,352
不要跳。不要！不要！
Don't jump. No! Don't!

15
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:58,813
不要跳，我告诉你
Don't jump, I tell you!

16
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,335
难道一个人就没有办法
Is there no way for a man

17
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:22,962
看起来很优雅
to look graceful

18
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,173
坠落时？
while falling?

19
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:33,098
你这话是什么意思？
What do you mean by that?

20
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,058
我加入你们只有一个条件。
There is only one condition
for me to join you.

21
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:39,896
你将把卜永菊从道达姆医院创伤中心带走。
You will remove Bu Yongju
from Doldam Hospital Trauma Center.

22
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:47,320
我们不能就你的工资或任何其他条件达成协议吗？
Can't we reach an agreement
with your salary or any other condition?

23
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,906
我不是在要求做交易，朴局长。
I'm not asking to make a deal,
Director Park.

24
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,077
教授，没有金师傅，我们的创伤中心就无法运作。
Professor, we can't run the Trauma Center
without Master Kim.

25
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:56,121
这是不可想象的。
It's unimaginable.

26
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:58,623
那么就让我们忘记我们曾经讨论过这个问题。
Then let's forget we ever discussed this.

27
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:09,592
查晋文教授
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN

28
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,779
是我。
It's me.

29
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,824
你想什么时候开始？
When do you want to start?

30
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,242
你希望我什么时候开始？
When would you like me to start?

31
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,661
一个星期内怎么样？
How about in one week?

32
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,497
到时候我再跟金师傅说。
I'll talk to Master Kim by then.

33
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:43,251
当然，你将不得不应对来自其他医生的阻力。
Of course, you will have to deal with
resistance from the other doctors.

34
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,211
我已经准备好应对这么多。
I'm prepared to deal with that much.

35
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:48,590
并在开始工作前让我了解其他细节。
And let me know about other details
before you start work.

36
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,091
好的。
Okay.

37
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,511
是的，到时候见。
Yes. I'll see you then.

38
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:08,484
他说他会这样做。
He says he'll do it.

39
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,283
干得好，朴局长。
Good work, Director Park.

40
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,202
- 金师傅。- 什么事？
- Master Kim.
- Yes?

41
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,163
我可以问你为什么吗？
May I ask you why?

42
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:22,916
你为什么做出这样的决定？
Why did you make such a decision?

43
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,585
你决定我们需要他
You determined that we need him

44
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:27,253
并想把他带到这里。
and wanted to bring him here.

45
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,966
不过，我还是不希望创伤中心没有你在。
Still, I didn't want the Trauma Center
without you there.

46
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,509
创伤中心...
The Trauma Center…

47
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:37,805
这是你长期以来的一个梦想。
had been a longtime dream of yours.

48
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,933
剥夺这一点将是一种欺骗。
Taking that away would be cheating.

49
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,309
朴主任。
Director Park.

50
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:44,687
你知道如何将大象放入冰箱吗？
Do you know how to put
an elephant into a fridge?

51
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,107
答案很简单。
The answer is simple.

52
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,151
打开门。
Open the door.

53
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,820
把大象放进去。然后，关闭门。
Put the elephant inside.
Then, close the door.

54
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:54,906
金师傅。
Master Kim.

55
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,825
但是，仅仅因为某些东西是简单的
But just because something is simple

56
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,203
并不意味着任何人都能做到这一点。
doesn't mean anyone can do it.

57
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:03,957
一个简单的解决方案并不容易。
A simple solution doesn't make it easy.

58
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,714
你和我才刚刚抓住了门把手。
You and I
have only just grabbed the doorknob.

59
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,279
查晋文教授!给我儿子的死亡一个答案!
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN!
GIVE ME AN ANSWER FOR MY SON'S DEATH!

60
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:51,337
查晋文教授!给我儿子的死亡一个答案!
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN!
GIVE ME AN ANSWER FOR MY SON'S DEATH!

61

(第三卷）把大象放在冰箱里，第二部分
(VOLUME 3)
PUTTING AN ELEPHANT IN A FRIDGE, PART 2

62
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,351
这里是道达姆医院的急诊室。
This is the Doldam Hospital ER.

63
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,187
是的，知道了。
Yes, got it.

64
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:11,190
张医生，三分钟后将有一位急诊病人到达。
Dr. Jang, an emergency patient
is arriving in three minutes.

65
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,818
哦，好的。你能帮他包扎一下吗？
Oh, okay. Can you bandage him up, please?

66
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,986
是的，医生。
Yes, Doctor.

67
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:19,073
哦，你需要看看八号床的裂缝伤口。
Oh, and you need to look at
the laceration wound in bed eight.

68
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:20,241
撕裂的伤口？好的。
Laceration wound? Okay.

69
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:23,494
张医生，二号床的病人的X光片已经出来了。
Dr. Jang, the X-ray is out
for the patient in bed two.

70
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:25,454
好的。
Okay.

71
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:29,857
哦，我们应该如何处理这个胃痛的病人？
Oh, what should we do
about the patient with the stomachache?

72
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:31,294
我会做的。
I'll do it.

73
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,546
张医生！八号床的裂缝伤口。
Dr. Jang!
The laceration wound in bed eight.

74
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,341
- 他们已经等了好一会儿了。- 好的。
- They've been waiting for a while.
- Okay.

75
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:38,217
医生，有这么多血。
Doctor, there's so much blood.

76
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,219
医生，请看一下这里。
Doctor, please take a look here.

77
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:41,888
- 医生。- 我们先来的。
- Doctor.
- We were here first.

78
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:43,681
- 但是这很紧急。- 医生。
- But this is urgent.
- Doctor.

79
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:45,085
- 请稍等。- 请帮助我们。
- Just a moment.
- Please help us.

80
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,226
- 医生。- 我们先来的。
- Doctor.
- We were here first.

81
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,186
- 医生？- 医生！
- Doctor?
- Doctor!

82
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,354
- 请原谅我。- 医生。
- Excuse me.
- Doctor.

83
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:51,773
郑仁秀博士和尹爱莲还没有来吗？
Are Dr. Jung Insu
and Yoon Areum not here yet?

84
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:54,108
荣格博士去参加了一个与主任的会议。
Dr. Jung went to a meeting
with the director.

85
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,027
而尹医生还没有来上班。
And Dr. Yoon hasn't come to work yet.

86
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:57,612
认真地说...
Seriously…

87
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,155
我们有一个病人!
We have a patient!

88
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,657
发生了一场车祸。
There was a car crash.

89
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,869
腹部有穿透性伤口。血压为80/40。心率120。
A penetrating wound in the abdomen.
BP is 80/40. Heart rate 120.

90
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,668
他的血压太低了。张医生，我们应该怎么做？
His BP is too low.
What should we do, Dr. Jang?

91
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:15,588
张医生!胃痛的病人怎么办？
Dr. Jang!
What about the stomachache patient?

92
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:18,257
张医生！八号床的撕裂伤！
Dr. Jang!
The laceration wound in bed eight!

93
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,134
- 张博士！张博士！张博士- 张博士！
- Dr. Jang!
- Dr. Jang!

94
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:21,636
张医生！八号床！
Dr. Jang! Bed eight!

95
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,221
等一下......等一下。
Wait… just a minute.

96
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:24,639
- 八号床！- 你在做什么？
- Bed eight!
- What are you doing?

97
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:27,266
- 请快点来!- 这很紧急！
- Please come quickly!
- It's urgent!

98
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,394
- 张博士！张博士！张博士- 张博士！

99
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,479
在这里！
Over here!

100
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:38,277
你现在在做什么？
What are you doing right now?

101
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,071
抓紧时间，朋克！
Get a grip, punk!

102
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:48,371
我们祝你健康
WE WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH

103
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:59,799
他只是站着睡着了，对吗？
He just fell asleep standing up, right?

104
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,717
我想他甚至做了一个梦。
I think he even had a dream.

105
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:06,639
你一定很累了，张医生。
You must be very tired, Dr. Jang.

106
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,433
是的...
Yes…

107
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:09,851
我很好。
I'm okay.

108
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,148
这是一个急诊病人!
It's an emergency patient!

109
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:24,449
这是一个26岁的男性。他是国家跳台滑雪队的成员。
It's a 26-year-old male.
He's on the national ski jump team.

110
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:27,160
他在训练中的一次着陆中受伤。
He was injured
while making a landing during training.

111
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:28,995
他的生命体征是126/82和68。
His vitals are 126/82 and 68.

112
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,581
他似乎没有任何外部伤害、
He doesn't seem to have
any external injuries,

113
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,144
但他正遭受着极度的痛苦。
but he's suffering from extreme pain.

114
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,419
- 让我们把他送进混合手术室。- 好的。
- Let's get him in the hybrid OR.
- Okay.

115
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,297
请在此等候。
Please wait here.

116
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
你不去吗？
Aren't you coming?

117
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:47,263
郑仁秀博士和尹阿伦博士的情况如何？
What about
Dr. Jung Insu and Dr. Yoon Areum?

118
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:49,223
荣格博士正在与主任开会。
Dr. Jung is in a meeting
with the director.

119
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:51,017
而尹医生还没有来上班。
And Dr. Yoon hasn't come to work yet.

120
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:54,770
张博士。
Dr. Jang.

121
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:56,063
张博士，快点。
Dr. Jang, hurry.

122
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:05,948
- 哦，你来了。- 是的，你好。
- Oh, you're here.
- Yes, hello.

123
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:10,077
把那个放在里面。不，不是那里。这就是了。
Put that inside. No, not there. That's it.

124
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,581
等等，这是新的。请确保不要撞到它。
Wait! That's new.
Make sure not to bump it.

125
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,542
- 是的，就是这样。- 你在做什么？
- Yes, that's it.
- What are you doing?

126
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:19,295
哦，徐医生。你只是来上班的吗？
Oh, Dr. Seo. Are you just coming to work?

127
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:21,881
今天将有一位新的CT外科研究员加入我们。
A new CT surgical fellow
will be joining us today.

128
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:23,758
我一直在为他们重新安排。
I've been rearranging for them.

129
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:26,469
车恩才要搬到这个房间吗？
Is Cha Eunjae moving to this room?

130
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:29,305
这是正确的。从现在起，普通外科医生将在一个房间里、
That's right. From now on,
general surgeons will be in one room,

131
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:30,788
和CT外科医生将在另一个地方。
and CT surgeons will be in another.

132
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,433
你将与自己的专业。
You will be with your own specialty.

133
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,479
但是，为什么有三张桌子？
But, why are there three desks?

134
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:40,942
我不确定。朴民国主任让我再准备一份。
I'm not sure. Director Park Minguk
asked me to prepare another.

135
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:44,111
无论如何，我不敢相信我能够目睹这一景象。
Anyway, I can't believe
I get to witness this sight.

136
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:47,615
仿佛就在昨天，我们还在管理医院，只有金师傅。
It seems only yesterday
we ran the hospital with just Master Kim.

137
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:51,285
说实话，当姜东柱博士和尹瑞亭博士加入我们时、
Honestly, when Dr. Kang Dongju
and Dr. Yoon Seojeong joined us,

138
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,413
我从来没有想过，金师傅的梦想会实现。
I never imagined that Master Kim's dream
would come true.

139
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:57,959
但有一个房间却挤满了普通外科医生、
But one room is overflowing
with general surgeons,

140
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:00,753
而另一个房间里都是心胸外科医生。
and another room is full
of cardiothoracic surgeons.

141
00:11:00,836 --> 00:11:03,798
在此基础上，创伤中心高高在上。
On top of that,
the Trauma Center is standing tall.

142
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:07,051
我被深深地感动了。
I am so deeply moved.

143
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,014
嘿，有个人在说话。
Hey, a man is talking.

144
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:14,392
天哪，他怎么会如此缺乏社交技巧？
Gosh, how could he be so lacking
in social skills?

145
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:16,936
我的天啊!对不起，别太在意。
My goodness! Sorry, go easy on that.

146
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,308
嘿，你来了。
Hey, you're here.

147
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,582
- 你整晚都在工作吗？- 当然了。
- Did you work all night?
- Of course.

148
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:01,741
我是待命的。当然，我整晚都在工作。
I was on call.
Of course I worked all night.

149
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,482
我一晚上都睡不着。
I couldn't sleep a wink.

150
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:04,859
你刚才不是在睡觉吗？
Weren't you sleeping just now?

151
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,153
睡觉？谁？
Sleeping? Who?

152
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,196
我没有睡觉。
I wasn't sleeping.

153
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,162
我给你带来了一些西红柿汁。
I brought you some tomato juice.

154
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,414
我在混合前把它们焯了一下。
I blanched them
before blending it.

155
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:19,832
味道应该还可以。
It should taste okay.

156
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,417
你自己做的？
You made it yourself?

157
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:24,670
- 你甚至把它们焯过水？- 是的。
- You even blanched them?
- Yes.

158
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,089
我甚至还亲自给它们焯水。
I even blanched them myself.

159
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:29,467
嘿，这是什么？
Hey, what is this?

160
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:33,262
你只用了几个西红柿就很动人。
You're quite moving
with just a few tomatoes.

161
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:38,809
当你在这时，也为我打开盖子。求你了？
While you're at it,
open the lid for me too. Please?

162
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,186
漂亮吗？
Pretty please?

163
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:50,404
对不起，我还在半梦半醒之间。
Sorry, I'm still half asleep.

164
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:52,114
我的舌头还没有完全醒过来。
My tongue isn't completely awake yet.

165
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:55,116
嗯!
Mmm!

166
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,412
这个味道不错。它是如此新鲜。
This tastes good. It's so fresh.

167
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:02,541
请忘记你刚才听到的内容。你能做到这一点吗？
Please forget what you just heard.
Can you do that?

168
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,127
不，我不能。
No, I can't.

169
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:08,130
这是我一时的错误，因为我很累。
It was a momentary error
on my part because I was tired.

170
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:09,632
请忘记它，好吗？
Please forget about it, okay?

171
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:10,715
我不想这样做。
I don't want to.

172
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:12,426
"漂亮的请。"
"Pretty please."

173
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,886
你又来了。
There you go again.

174
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:16,180
这个人将持续一段时间。什么？"请漂亮点"？
This one will last a while.
What? "Pretty please?"

175
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,682
别说了，徐宇镇。
Stop it, Seo Woojin.

176
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:18,766
- "漂亮吗？"- 嘿。
- "Pretty please?"
- Hey.

177
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:20,184
- 漂亮...- 嘘嘘。
- Pretty...
- Hush.

178
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:22,036
- 有人可能会听到。- 好吧，我不说了。
- Someone might hear.
- Okay, I'll stop.

179
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:25,439
- 但 "漂亮的请"？好吧，我不说了。- 认真地说，我说了停。
- But "pretty please?" Okay, I'll stop.
- Seriously, I said stop.

180
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:36,367
李承恩医生。这位是普通外科的徐武进医生。
Dr. Lee Seonung.
This is Dr. Seo Woojin in general surgery.

181
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,704
你好。我们上次在船上见过面。
Hello. We met on the boat last time.

182
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:45,251
哦，你一定是新的CT外科研究员。
Oh, you must be the new CT surgery fellow.

183
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:46,836
我是李璇。
I'm Lee Seonung.

184
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,839
从今天起，我将在道达姆医院报到。
As of today, I'm reporting to duty
at Doldam Hospital.

185
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,132
金师傅雇用了我。
Master Kim hired me.

186
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,134
很高兴见到你。我希望我们能相处愉快。
It's good to see you. I hope we get along.

187
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,468
请漂亮点。
Pretty please.

188
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:56,761
什么？
What?

189
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,894
这是一个来自急诊室的电话。
It's a call from the ER.

190
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,689
回头见，车恩杰博士。
See you later, Dr. Cha Eunjae.

191
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,733
祝你有个愉快的一天。
Have a good day.

192
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,698
他刚才说什么了？
What did he just say?

193
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:17,575
哦，别管他。
Oh, don't mind him.

194
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,870
他有时就是这样。他甚至一点都不好笑，但他努力了。
He's just like that sometimes.
He's not even funny, but he tries.

195
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:22,356
但他一点都不好笑，对吗？
But he's not funny at all, right?

196
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,331
天哪，说真的。
Gosh, seriously.

197
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:29,170
你喜欢番茄汁吗？
Do you like tomato juice?

198
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,254
是的。
Yes.

199
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:32,965
我们有什么？
What do we have?

200
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:37,011
他是国家跳台滑雪队的成员。他在落地时受伤。
He's on the national ski jump team.
He was injured while landing.

201
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,930
裴文静医生正在查看他的膝关节韧带。
Dr. Bae Munjeong
is looking at his knee ligaments.

202
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,349
但他一直说他有胃痛。
But he keeps saying he has stomach pain.

203
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,684
- CT怎么办？- CT...
- What about the CT?
- The CT…

204
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,104
CT显示前腹部的一部分有壁增强。
The CT shows wall enhancement
in a part of the front abdomen.

205
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:48,981
我想我们需要做一个手术观察。
I think we need to do
a surgical observation.

206
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:50,941
- 就在这里？- 是的。
- Right here?
- Yes.

207
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:57,031
但在后面，通气性看起来很好，尺寸也很小。
But in the back, the aeration looks good
and the size is small.

208
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:59,658
我认为增强的原因只是因为肠子肿胀了。
I think the enhancement is
just from the swollen bowels.

209
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,702
这是真的，但是...
That's true, but…

210
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,749
- 腹泻怎么办？- 没有。
- What about diarrhea?
- There is none.

211
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:08,709
- 他的化验结果如何？- 他的白细胞是9,000。
- What about his labs?
- His WBC is 9,000.

212
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:10,252
只有他的CRP略有升高。
Only his CRP is slightly elevated.

213
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,170
身体状况？
Physical condition?

214
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,005
RLQ里有一些温柔的东西。
There's some tenderness in the RLQ.

215
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,006
而且没有反弹？
And there's no rebound?

216
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,925
这并不突出。
It's not prominent.

217
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:17,968
它要么在那里，要么不在。
It's either there or not.

218
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:19,678
你说的不突出是什么意思？
What do you mean by not prominent?

219
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:22,139
病人一直说它很疼。
The patient keeps saying it hurts.

220
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,600
- 病人在哪里？- 在混合手术室。
- Where is the patient?
- In the hybrid OR.

221
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:32,650
膝关节韧带没有任何问题。
There's nothing wrong
with the knee ligaments.

222
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,236
对，我也说过同样的话、
Right, I said the same thing,

223
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:37,404
但病人一直说它很疼。
but the patient keeps saying
that it hurts.

224
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,490
请原谅我。
Excuse me.

225
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:43,160
他在三年前做了十字韧带手术。
He had surgery on his ACL three years ago.

226
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:46,121
哦，但现在看起来很好。
Oh, but it seems fine now.

227
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,582
我的胃痛得厉害。
My stomach hurts so much.

228
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,335
哦，我的胃。它正在杀害我。
Oh, my stomach. It's killing me.

229
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:54,713
让我看一下。
Let me take a look.

230
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,632
嘿，徐医生。你来了。
Hey, Dr. Seo. You're here.

231
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,176
病人一直抱怨胃痛。
The patient keeps complaining
about stomach pain.

232
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,471
但在CT扫描中并没有什么特别的东西。
But there isn't anything in particular
in the CT scan.

233
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,018
先生，请原谅我离开一下。
Sir, excuse me for a minute.

234
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:09,895
把你的膝盖抬起来。
Bring your knee up.

235
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,025
- 如果我按这里，会不会很疼？- 是的。
- Does it hurt if I press here?
- Yes.

236
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,902
这一边呢？
What about this side?

237
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,445
右边还疼吗？
Does the right side still hurt?

238
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:19,864
是的，确实如此。
Yes, it does.

239
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:22,658
让我看看你的衣服下面。
Let me look under your clothes.

240
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:26,912
如果我像这样点击它呢？
What if I tap on it like this?

241
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:27,997
这也很伤人。
That hurts too.

242
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,748
你能用点力气咳嗽吗？
Can you cough with some force?

243
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:37,608
你是否感到胃里有响声？
Do you feel a ringing in your stomach?

244
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:38,841
是的，我感觉到了。
Yes, I feel it.

245
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:43,888
让我们尝试一下不同的位置并进行比较。
Let's try a different position
and compare.

246
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,307
抬起你的腿。收紧你的肌肉。
Lift your legs. Tighten your muscles.

247
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,475
抬起你的头，看着你的膝盖。
Lift your head and look at your knees.

248
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:57,151
哪一个更伤人？早些时候还是现在？
Which one hurts more? Earlier or now?

249
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:59,028
这更让人伤心。
This hurts more.

250
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,157
好了，你现在可以放松了。
Okay. You can relax now.

251
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:05,992
张东华。
Jang Donghwa.

252
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:07,036
是吗？
Yes?

253
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:09,413
你检查过卡耐特的标志吗？
Did you check for Carnett's sign?

254
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,873
我做了...
I did…

255
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:12,836
那么你为什么建议进行手术观察？
Then why did you suggest
a surgical observation?

256
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,335
根本就没有肌肉的守护。
There's no muscle guarding at all.

257
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,130
请原谅我。怎么了？有什么不对吗？
Excuse me. What is it? Is something wrong?

258
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:21,675
这不是什么大事。这是一种常见的疾病
It's nothing big. It's a common illness

259
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,259
称为伪造。
called faking.

260
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:33,646
这是什么？
What is this?

261
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,273
你是故意在落地时摔倒的吗？
Did you fall while landing on purpose?

262
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:38,984
不，我没有。我真的很痛苦。
No, I didn't. I really am hurting.

263
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:40,903
你为什么不相信我？
Why won't you believe me?

264
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:44,031
骨科医生和我都同意。
The orthopedic surgeon and I agree.

265
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:46,200
考试结果没有任何问题。
There is nothing wrong
with the exam results.

266
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:47,993
真是一群庸医！"！
What a bunch of quacks!

267
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,995
如果考试成绩没有问题，是不是就没事了？
Is it all fine
if the exam results are fine?

268
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,206
我告诉你我很痛苦!
I'm telling you I'm in pain!

269
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,750
你这个可悲的傻瓜!
You pathetic fool!

270
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,419
比赛还有几天就开始了。这是什么？
The competition is days away.
What is this?

271
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:02,007
你浪费了我们的时间，在这个不吉利的时间里大惊小怪！
You wasted our time fussing over nothing,
at this ungodly hour!

272
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:04,051
我真的很痛苦!
I really was in pain!

273
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:07,388
忘了它吧，小混混！为什么，我应该把你撕碎。
Forget it, punk!
Why, I ought to rip you apart.

274
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:10,057
先生，你不能在这里这么大声说话......
Sir, you can't speak so loudly here...

275
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,519
你认为赢得一枚金牌是一个巨大的成就吗？
Do you think winning one gold medal
is a huge accomplishment?

276
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:16,397
你有吗？不要自以为是。
Do you? Don't flatter yourself.

277
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,023
明白了吗？
Got it?

278
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:21,568
勋章只是你生命中的一个小点。
A medal is just a tiny dot in your life.

279
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,655
你所做的只是在地图上放了一个点。
All you did was put a dot on the map.

280
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,199
你不是什么大人物。
You're no big shot.

281
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:29,535
你的傲慢是僵硬的，甚至不愿意练习。
You're stiff with arrogance
and won't even practice.

282
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:30,828
而现在，你假装受伤？
And now, you fake an injury?

283
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,080
你...
You…

284
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,980
你知道如果你因傲慢而变得过于僵硬会发生什么吗？
Do you know what happens
if you get too stiff with arrogance?

285
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,794
即使最轻微的错误也会导致巨大的伤害。
Even the slightest error
can lead to a huge injury.

286
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:40,838
明白了吗？
Got that?

287
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:43,007
一个人的生活也是如此。
A person's life is the same way.

288
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:44,675
朋克。
Punk.

289
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:51,598
天哪，我很抱歉。
Gosh, I'm sorry.

290
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:58,856
你在做什么？快起来吧！
What are you doing? Get up already!

291
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,747
天哪，那个教练真吓人。
Gosh, that coach is scary.

292
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,499
他肯定已经装了好几次了。
He must've faked it several times already.

293
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,420
让他走是对的吗？他说他很痛苦。
Is it right to let him go?
He says he's in pain.

294
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:24,256
尽管如此，我们也无能为力。
Still, there's nothing we can do.

295
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,342
我也是这么想的。我确信他们有队医。
That's what I think too.
I'm sure they have team doctors.

296
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:29,720
让我们尽我们所能吧，荣格医生。
Let's just do what we can, Dr. Jung.

297
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,931
好吧，如果OS和GS是这么说的。
Okay, if that's what OS and GS say.

298
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:34,808
我将暂时让他出院。
I'll discharge him for now.

299
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:44,692
请原谅我。
Excuse me.

300
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,030
关于赵善均先生...
About Mr. Cho Sungyoon…

301
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,866
我们不能给他打点滴，让他休息几个小时吗？
Couldn't we give him an IV
and let him rest for a few hours?

302
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,951
那是什么意思？
What does that mean?

303
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,204
压力也是一种类型的疾病。
Stress is a type of illness too.

304
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,332
经过几天的休息，他可以变得更好。
He could get better
with a few days of rest.

305
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:01,627
从什么时候开始，GS外科医生开始管理病人的压力水平？
Since when did GS surgeons
start to manage patients' stress levels?

306
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:03,753
什么？
Pardon?

307
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:08,050
没错，医生可以对病人产生同情心。
Right, a doctor can feel sympathetic
for a patient.

308
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,677
但这就是全部。
But that's all.

309
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,306
你告诉我做我必须做的事。
You told me to do what I had to do.

310
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,603
我的意思是你应该尽力做好你的工作。
I meant you should do your best
at your job.

311
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:21,563
你刚才所做的是过头了。
What you just did is go overboard.

312
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,066
不要把这两者混为一谈。
Don't confuse those two.

313
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:32,407
认真地说。
Seriously.

314
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,330
信息
INFORMATION

315
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:40,165
这一定是缺乏技巧，对吗？
It must be
a lack of finesse, right?

316
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,919
- 我是说徐医生。- 嗯。
- Dr. Seo, I mean.
- Mm.

317
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:47,506
我认为他说这些话是为了教导张博士、
I think he says what he says
to teach Dr. Jang,

318
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:49,883
但张博士似乎被他的话所伤。
but Dr. Jang seems to be hurt
by his words.

319
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:55,681
我觉得我在观察你的早期生活。
I feel like I'm watching you
in your early days.

320
00:20:58,725 --> 00:20:59,726
天哪。
Gosh.

321
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:03,522
杨浩军不是负责居民的吗？
Wasn't Yang Hojun in charge
of the residents?

322
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:05,566
是的，他应该是这样的。
Yes, he was supposed to be.

323
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,318
我确信他把它传给了徐医生。
I'm sure he passed it on to Dr. Seo.

324
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,529
无论如何，他是世界上最好的
Anyway, he's the world's best

325
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:13,157
在无耻和没有责任感的情况下。
at being shameless
and having no sense of responsibility.

326
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:23,458
所以...
So…

327
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:27,087
你就不能理清这两者之间的关系吗？
can't you clear up some traffic
between those two?

328
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:30,215
天哪，别管他们了。
Gosh, leave them alone.

329
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,677
如果大人们为了这些事情而插手、
If grown-ups butt in
for these things,

330
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,180
它只会使事情变得更加复杂。
it will only make things more complicated.

331
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:40,475
他们需要对头，并为之结缘。
They need to butt heads and bond over it.

332
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,936
这就是他们成长的方式。
That's how they'll grow up.

333
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:50,527
张东华博士！
Dr. Jang Donghwa!

334
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:54,031
为金英九先生吸气。
Suction for Mr. Kim Inguk.

335
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,494
在接下来的一个小时里，请密切关注这个病人。
Keep an eye on this patient
for the next hour.

336
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:13,889
他是一个有肠梗阻的糖尿病患者。
He's a diabetic
with an intestinal obstruction.

337
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,207
你应该如何进行肠道休息？
How should you do a bowel rest?

338
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:18,013
他不应该口服任何东西，给他输液。
He should take nothing by mouth
and give him an IV.

339
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:20,641
那是在他没有糖尿病的时候。
That's when he isn't diabetic.

340
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:22,726
一位糖尿病患者
A diabetic patient

341
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,061
可能会进入低血糖状态。
could go into hypoglycemia.

342
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:25,864
所以你应该给他提供TPN，而不仅仅是输液。
So you should give him TPN,
not just fluids.

343
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:28,273
哦，对了。
Oh, right.

344
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:55,884
如果我再发现你在医院里玩游戏、
If I catch you playing games
in the hospital again,

345
00:22:55,968 --> 00:22:57,427
你要加两小时的班。
you'll work two hours of overtime.

346
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:00,931
如果你想的话，就试试吧。
Try it if you want to.

347
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,603
张东华
JANG DONGHWA

348
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,029
张医生，你查过明天的手术安排吗？
Dr. Jang, have you checked
tomorrow's surgery schedule?

349
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:19,700
我现在正在做。
I'm on it now.

350
00:23:20,117 --> 00:23:21,118
认真地说。
Seriously.

351
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,993
昨天的腹部受伤病人的报告在哪里？
Where is the report
on yesterday's abdomen injury patient?

352
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:36,717
我现在就去做。
I'll do it now.

353
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:55,861
不要忘记在今天下午之前整理好病例报告。
Don't forget to organize
the case report by this afternoon.

354
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:57,487
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

355
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,530
你累了吗？
Are you tired?

356
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,032
不，先生。
No, sir.

357
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,080
是的，有一点。
Yes, a bit.

358
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,082
这意味着你做得很好。
That means you're doing well.

359
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,250
给你。
Here you go.

360
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:54,668
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

361
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,270
哦，你在这里。
Oh, there you are.

362
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,439
你做过手术吗？
Did you have surgery?

363
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,316
我有一些练习要做。
I had some practice to do.

364
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:19,069
我现在已经完成了。
I'm done now.

365
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,155
这很难，不是吗？
It's hard, isn't it?

366
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,659
嗯，这很好。
Well, it's fine.

367
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:29,830
别紧张。
Take it easy.

368
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:32,374
容易。
Easy.

369
00:25:39,965 --> 00:25:42,008
我敢打赌，他并不了解。
I'm betting that
he didn't understand.

370
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:46,179
你认为是这样吗？
Do you think so?

371
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:49,641
即使对一个头脑冷静的人来说也是如此、
Even for a cool-headed man,

372
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:54,271
客观地看待自己并不是一件容易的事，金师傅。
being objective about himself
is not an easy thing, Master Kim.

373
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:02,696
顺便说一下，你说你想告诉我一些事情。
By the way,
you said you wanted to tell me something.

374
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:04,990
它是什么？
What is it?

375
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
什么？
What?

376
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,412
创伤中心的新负责人？
A new head of the Trauma Center?

377
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,830
谁？
Who?

378
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,374
好吧、
Well,

379
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:18,170
我也不确定这些传言是否属实。
I'm not sure
if the rumors are true either.

380
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:23,425
我听说车振文医生将来担任创伤中心的负责人。
I hear Dr. Cha Jinman will be coming
as head of the Trauma Center.

381
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:25,594
你说的车振文医生，是指...
By Dr. Cha Jinman, do you mean…

382
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:28,221
车恩才的父亲？
Cha Eunjae's dad?

383
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:29,598
是的。
Yes.

384
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:46,072
希望、爱、服务
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

385
00:26:49,326 --> 00:26:52,329
行政办公室
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

386
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:01,880
哇哦!
Wow!

387
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:05,091
多好啊。这真是太完美了!
How nice. This is perfect!

388
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:08,595
现在我有了一个新的小辈，伟大的事情正在发生。
Great things are happening
now that I have a new junior.

389
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,973
现在，CT外科医生正在接管多尔达姆医院。
Now, CT surgeons are
taking over Doldam Hospital.

390
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,225
让我们来扫荡董事会，好吗？
Let's sweep the board, okay?

391
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:17,020
我缺乏实践经验。我有很多东西要学。
I'm lacking in practical experience.
I have a lot to learn.

392
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,607
不要担心。不要紧张。
Don't worry. Don't be nervous.

393
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,651
如果你有任何问题，随时可以问我。
If you have any questions, ask me anytime.

394
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,277
如果你需要任何帮助，请向我求助。
And if you need any help, ask for it.

395
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:29,324
你很快就会明白的，但多丹这里的人都很好。
You'll catch on soon enough,
but everyone here at Doldam is nice.

396
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:31,535
嗯...
Well…

397
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:35,205
只是要注意GS中的杨浩军医生。他不是那么伟大。
Just watch out for Dr. Yang Hojun in GS.
He's not that great.

398
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:43,797
顺便说一下，为什么有三张桌子？
By the way, why are there three desks?

399
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,048
哦...
Oh…

400
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:46,758
我不确定。
I'm not sure.

401
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,094
不可能。
No way.

402
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:54,015
以他的技能和他的名字价值，这不是不可能的事。
With his skills and his name value,
it's not out of the question.

403
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:58,144
事实上，我们从中获得了很多，吴女士。
In fact,
we're gaining a lot from this, Ms. Oh.

404
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:02,257
难道又是朴局长干的？
Is it Director Park's doing again?

405
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,401
是的，对吗？他向你施压，让你这样做。
It is, right? He pressured you into this.

406
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:07,445
天哪。不，它不是。
Gosh. No, it isn't.

407
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:10,323
这一次他说了什么来达到自己的目的？
What did he say this time
to get his own way?

408
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:13,451
他有没有利用开幕式的日期来对付你？或紧急直升机？
Did he use the opening date against you?
Or the emergency helicopter?

409
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,370
他用了什么样的借口
What kind of excuse did he use

410
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:17,453
来窃取创伤中心负责人的职位？
to steal the position of
head of the Trauma Center?

411
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,875
我没有从他那里偷来，吴女士。
I didn't steal it from him, Ms. Oh.

412
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,837
我从外面听到了你的声音。
I heard your voice from outside.

413
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:26,461
我不是故意的，但我无意中听到了你们的谈话。
I didn't mean to,
but I overheard your conversation.

414
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:28,091
我很高兴你已经听到了我的话。
I'm glad you already heard me.

415
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:31,761
当面告诉我。
Tell me in person.

416
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,888
你隐藏着什么样的情节
What kind of plot are you hiding

417
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:36,433
这个荒谬的人事任命背后是什么？
behind this ridiculous
personnel appointment?

418
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:37,976
没有任何情节。
There is no plot.

419
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:39,894
我很难过，吴女士。
I'm upset, Ms. Oh.

420
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:43,648
在过去的三年里，我一直以忠诚和真诚的态度工作。
I've been working with loyalty
and sincerity over the past three years.

421
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:46,651
这不是太荒唐的决定了，称之为忠诚和真诚吗？
Isn't this too absurd of a decision
to call it loyalty and sincerity?

422
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:49,395
你怎么能用那个万能的位置来做这件事呢？
How could you do that with
that position of all things?

423
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:53,158
你是如何培养这种随机和无意义的创造力的？
How do you develop such random
and senseless creativity?

424
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:56,202
我告诉你这是我的主意。
I told you it was my idea.

425
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:58,872
这就是我的意思!这是金师傅的主意...
That's what I mean!
It was Master Kim's idea…

426
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:04,085
- 什么 我说我们应该这样做。
- What?
- I said we should do it.

427
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:06,379
- 但是......--明国：看。
- But…
- MINGUK: Look.

428
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:08,143
我们以后再来澄清这个误解吧。
Let's clear up the misunderstanding later.

429
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:10,300
我们现在先到我的办公室去吧。
Let's go up to my office for now.

430
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:14,054
车金满教授刚到。
Professor Cha Jinman just arrived.

431
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,223
我们就这么做吧。
Let's do that.

432
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,935
后来。
Later.

433
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:23,229
- 我们以后再谈吧，吴女士 但是......。
- Let's talk later, Ms. Oh.
- But…

434
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,400
- 我们走吧。- 好的。
- Let's go.
- Okay.

435
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:31,988
但为什么呢？
But why?

436
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:34,574
究竟为什么？
Why on earth?

437
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:42,082
那我就不打扰你们了。
Then I'll leave you to talk.

438
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,924
我非常感谢你能来这里，查教授。
I'm so grateful to have you here,
Professor Cha.

439
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:52,007
欢迎。
Welcome.

440
00:29:58,682 --> 00:29:59,599
在这里。
Here.

441
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:02,811
我已经想出了一份加入创伤中心的医生名单。
I've come up with a list of doctors
to join the Trauma Center.

442
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:03,978
啊，是的。
Ah, yes.

443
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:07,982
其中有几个人给了我积极的回应。
A few of them have given me
positive responses.

444
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:11,981
多尔达姆医院创伤中心推荐医生名单
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER
RECOMMENDED DOCTOR LIST

445
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:16,658
多尔达姆的外科医生不在这里。
The Doldam surgeons aren't on here.

446
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:21,538
我还没能确认他们的技能。
I haven't been able
to confirm their skills yet.

447
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:24,666
你不需要担心这个问题。
You don't have to worry
about that.

448
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:28,378
多尔达姆外科医生的专长是治疗创伤病人。
The Doldam surgeons' specialty
is treating trauma patients.

449
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:30,880
金师傅一直专注于这个领域
Master Kim has focused on that area

450
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:33,550
并训练他们成为一个好的团队。
and trained them to be a good team.

451
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:34,633
朴主任。
Director Park.

452
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:37,345
我评判人的标准
My standards of judging people

453
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:40,223
与卜永菊的情况完全不同。
is quite different from Bu Yongju's.

454
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:44,269
我的教学风格也应大不相同。
My style of teaching
should differ greatly as well.

455
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:45,895
不可能。
No way.

456
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:50,233
你的意思不是说你会因为我而把外科医生排除在多德姆之外，对吗？
You don't mean you will exclude surgeons
from Doldam because of me, right?

457
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,319
我的意思是我们不能给多丹的外科医生任何特殊待遇。
I mean we can't give Doldam surgeons
any special treatment.

458
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,072
这个中心靠政府资助运行。
This center runs on government funding.

459
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:58,283
规则必须是公平的。
The rules must be fair.

460
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:01,578
此外，技能可能对治疗创伤很重要、
Besides, skill may be important
in treating trauma,

461
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:04,122
但团队合作也是如此。
but so is teamwork.

462
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,915
你说你会根据技能进行公平判断。
You said you'd judge fairly
based on skill.

463
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:09,753
但在我听来，你会有非常个人的标准。
But it sounds to me that you will have
very personal standards.

464
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:15,383
说实话，如果他们向你学习，他们会怎么样是很明显的。
To be honest, it's obvious
how they'd be if they learned from you.

465
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:18,303
他们将是鲁莽的，无礼的、
They will be reckless, insolent,

466
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,389
或出于傲慢而乐于挥舞手术刀。
or happy to wield a scalpel
out of arrogance.

467
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:22,599
像这样的人。
People like that.

468
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:24,100
你喜欢这样的孩子。
You like kids like that.

469
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:28,646
我确实赞成那些为病人做他们必须做的事情的医生。
I do favor doctors
who do what they must for patients.

470
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,317
如果他们有一双好手，那就更好了。
And if they have good hands, even better.

471
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,195
好手并不总是能成为好医生。
A good hand doesn't always
make a good doctor.

472
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:36,362
正是如此。
Exactly.

473
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,200
就像好的考试成绩也不能成为好医生一样。
Just like how good test scores
don't make good doctors either.

474
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:51,544
嗯...
Well…

475
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:55,423
我认为我们现在不能就人事问题作出决定。
I don't think we can decide on
personnel matters right now.

476
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,258
你这么自信吗？
Are you so confident?

477
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:04,891
如果我没有信心、
If I weren't confident,

478
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,851
我是否会安排这次会议？
would I have set up this meeting?

479
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:10,355
我相信你知道，我的标准
I'm sure you know that my standards

480
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:12,982
是非常挑剔和保守的。
are very picky and conservative.

481
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:16,569
我确实记得，你的狭隘和固执让我感到沮丧。
I do remember that you frustrated me with
your narrow-minded and stubborn nature.

482
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:21,658
好吧，在创伤中心开放之前，我们仍有一些时间。
Well, we still have some time
until the Trauma Center opens.

483
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:23,034
所以，在适当的时候...
So, in due time…

484
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:24,327
那么，我们就来吧。
Let's do it, then.

485
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,080
让我们看看多尔丹的外科医生有多厉害。
Let's see how good Doldam's surgeons are.

486
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,541
如果你自己操作，效果会更好。
It would be better
if you operate yourself.

487
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:33,670
我想看看你有多好，因为已经过去这么久了。
I want to see how good you are
since it's been so long.

488
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:38,508
我想知道这些年来你的技能有多大的提高。
I wonder how much your skills
have improved over the years.

489
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:40,802
- 你不是在喝这个，是吗？- 金师傅。
- You're not drinking this, are you?
- Master Kim.

490
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:43,429
我想知道
I wonder

491
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:46,015
如果你已经生疏了。
if you've gotten rusty at all.

492
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:00,405
让我们在适当的时候讨论人事问题。
Let's discuss personnel matters
in due time.

493
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:03,116
我带你看看你将使用的房间，查教授。
I'll show you the room
that you will be using, Professor Cha.

494
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:05,535
房间？
Room?

495
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:09,497
我给你指路。
I'll show you the way.

496
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:11,415
我们走吧。
Let's go.

497
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,002
查教授？
Professor Cha?

498
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:26,890
你真的会好起来吗？
Will you really be okay?

499
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,473
不要问。
Don't ask.

500
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:33,104
我只是为这个决定后悔了大约三秒钟。
I was just regretting this decision
for about three seconds.

501
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:36,482
他还没有签署合同。
He hasn't signed the contract yet.

502
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:38,943
如果你改变了主意，现在告诉我还不算太晚。
It's not too late to tell me
if you've changed your mind.

503
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:43,990
我们不能在打开门之前就结束事情。
We can't end things
before we even open the door.

504
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:47,285
所以最终，你真的会进入这扇窄门？
So ultimately,
you really will enter this narrow door?

505
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:48,620
如果你拿起一把剑、
If you pick up a sword,

506
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:51,456
至少你可以做的是拔掉它的剑鞘。
the least you can do is unsheathe it.

507
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,707
好的。
Okay.

508
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,711
记住。那是我给你的最后机会。
Remember.
That was the last chance I gave you.

509
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,772
当我第一次在创伤中心看到你时、
When I first saw you
in the Trauma Center,

510
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:16,940
你就像复仇者联盟。
you were like the Avengers.

511
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:18,942
- 认真的。- 复仇者联盟？别奉承我了。
- Seriously.
- The Avengers? Don't flatter me.

512
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:21,110
总之，我很荣幸能与你合作。
Anyway,
I'm honored to work with you.

513
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:22,028
获得荣誉？
Honored?

514
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:24,197
李博士，你用了这么甜蜜的字眼。你很荣幸。
Dr. Lee, you use such sweet words.
You're honored.

515
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,865
我真的觉得你很了不起。
I really think you're impressive.

516
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:29,410
完全可以理解。我知道我们这些外科医生都很厉害。
Totally understandable.
I know we surgeons are pretty impressive.

517
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,870
嗯!
Mmm!

518
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:34,457
李博士，你是我们的幸运符。
Dr. Lee, you're our lucky charm.

519
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:36,584
这是你自己调配的吗？天哪。
Did you blend this yourself? Gosh.

520
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:38,753
我没有做，但它很好，对吗？
I didn't make it, but it's good, right?

521
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:39,879
嗯!
Mmm!

522
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,844
怎么了，徐医生？
What is it, Dr. Seo?

523
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:48,972
这里是CS室。进来之前请敲门。
This is the CS room.
Knock before you come in.

524
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:57,063
李博士。
Dr. Lee.

525
00:34:57,605 --> 00:34:59,107
你去过急诊室了吗？
Have you been to the ER yet?

526
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:02,360
你想四处看看，跟急诊室的人打个招呼吗？
Do you want to look around
and say hi to the ER folks?

527
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,450
为什么？你有什么要告诉我吗，徐医生？
Why? Do you have something
to tell me, Dr. Seo?

528
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:11,869
你不觉得你有事情要告诉我吗，查医生？
Don't you think you have something
to tell me, Dr. Cha?

529
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:14,455
后来。
Later.

530
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:16,916
我们以后再谈吧。
Let's talk later.

531
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:20,753
我现在和李博士有事情要做。
I have something to do
with Dr. Lee right now.

532
00:35:20,837 --> 00:35:23,131
李博士，你能让我们在房间里待一会儿吗？
Dr. Lee, could you give us the room
for a moment?

533
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:24,979
我有事情要和查医生讨论。
I have something to discuss with Dr. Cha.

534
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:26,384
是的，当然了。
Yes, of course.

535
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,467
不，李博士！
No, Dr. Lee!

536
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:30,430
- 没有必要离开。- 好的。
- There's no need to leave.
- Okay.

537
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:31,889
我只需要5分钟，李博士。
I just need five minutes, Dr. Lee.

538
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:33,725
哦，好的。
Oh, okay.

539
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:36,019
李医生，你只需要听一个CT外科医生同行的话。
Dr. Lee, you only need to listen
to a fellow CT surgeon.

540
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:38,145
李博士。
Dr. Lee.

541
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,357
来吧，我肯定你听错了什么。
Come on, I'm sure you misheard something.

542
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:26,569
所有地方中的创伤中心？那个地方就是金师傅的...
The Trauma Center of all places?
That place is Master Kim's...

543
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,488
我是听金师傅自己说的。
I heard it from Master Kim himself.

544
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:30,990
我知道。那么主人......什么？
I know. So Master… What?

545
00:36:31,074 --> 00:36:33,242
他为什么突然做出这个决定？
Why did he make that decision
all of a sudden?

546
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:36,037
如果朴主任不给他压力、
If Director Park didn't pressure him,

547
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,456
并且他自己做出了这个决定、
and he made this decision himself,

548
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:40,625
这更是一个谜。
it's even more of a mystery.

549
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,709
也许、
Perhaps,

550
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,260
会不会是因为他的多发性硬化症？
could it be because
of his multiple sclerosis?

551
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,050
他的症状可能在我们不知道的情况下变得更糟。
His symptoms might have gotten worse
without our knowing.

552
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:51,636
来吧，不可能的。
Come on, there's no way.

553
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,971
他在休息日一直去钓鱼、
He's been going fishing on his days off,

554
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:56,349
获得大量的新鲜空气和运动。
getting plenty of fresh air and exercise.

555
00:36:56,432 --> 00:36:58,726
他一直在努力工作以保持健康。
He's been working hard
to keep up his health.

556
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,188
对，当我们上个月做了一些血检和其他一些测试、
Right, when we did some bloodwork
and a few other tests last month,

557
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:03,648
他的所有结果都没有问题。
all his results were okay.

558
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:06,484
对，我怀疑是这样的，吴女士。
Right, I doubt that's what it is, Ms. Oh.

559
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:10,822
如果不是这样，我就是完全不明白。
If that's not it,
I just don't understand it at all.

560
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,802
你在这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

561
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,102
我需要一个解释，先生。
I need an explanation, sir.

562
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:42,686
什么？
What?

563
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:53,822
天哪。
Gosh.

564
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:00,663
首先，金师傅。
First of all, Master Kim.

565
00:38:01,164 --> 00:38:03,332
车金满作为创伤中心的负责人？
Cha Jinman as head of the Trauma Center?

566
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,626
是否有
Is there

567
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,462
其他一些我们不知道的原因？
some other reason that we don't know of?

568
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:12,967
如果不是，我就是不明白。
If not, I just don't get it.

569
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,468
不，吴女士。
No, Ms. Oh.

570
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:18,973
这个职位应该向任何有能力的人开放、
That position should be open
to anyone capable,

571
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:22,059
即使那不是我。
even if that isn't me.

572
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,313
说你不能理解
Saying that
you can't understand that

573
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:28,274
是一个危险的想法。
is a dangerous thought.

574
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:31,986
我知道。
I know.

575
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,490
我们都在为创伤中心的工作而努力。
We've all been working very hard
for the Trauma Center.

576
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,702
如果不是因为你的努力和奉献、
And if not
for your efforts and dedication,

577
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,621
我们就不会走到这一步。
we wouldn't have gotten this far.

578
00:38:41,704 --> 00:38:45,249
但努力和献身精神
But effort and dedication

579
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,793
应该在你给他们的那一刻就留下。
should be left behind
the moment you've given them.

580
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:50,171
希望得到某种形式的付款
Hoping for some kind of payment

581
00:38:50,254 --> 00:38:52,215
或要求承认你的投入、
or demanding recognition of your input,

582
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:56,302
事情会在瞬间变成一团泥泞。
things will turn into
a muddy mess in a flash.

583
00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:57,886
但是、
But,

584
00:38:58,221 --> 00:39:02,266
创伤中心的负责人应该是负责任的领导。
the head of the Trauma Center
should be the leader who will take charge.

585
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,685
这个职位应该被填补
That position should be filled

586
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,688
经过更仔细和缜密的考虑。
after more careful
and meticulous consideration.

587
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,405
如果你们所有人都继续努力工作
If all of you keep working hard

588
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,699
在你们各自的岗位上、
in your respective positions,

589
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:22,370
不会因为我们雇了人就发生什么大的变化。
nothing drastic will happen
just because we hired someone

590
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:25,248
从外面来，成为创伤中心的新负责人。
from the outside
to be the new head of the Trauma Center.

591
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:28,833
我的天啊。
My goodness.

592
00:39:29,377 --> 00:39:30,711
我知道。
I know.

593
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:34,924
这对我们来说也将是一个考验。
This will be a test for us too.

594
00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:36,007
然而、
However,

595
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:41,097
我们一开业就会有更多的外伤病人、
we will have more trauma patients
once we open,

596
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,433
那么我们就需要更多的医生。
then we'll need more doctors.

597
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,561
不接受新医生、
Without accepting new doctors,

598
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,398
你认为我们能坚持多久？
how much longer do you think
we can hold out?

599
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:54,235
因此，请、
So please,

600
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:56,988
接受我的决定，不要有任何偏见。
accept my decision without any bias.

601
00:39:58,072 --> 00:39:59,657
好的，吴女士？
Okay, Ms. Oh?

602
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,370
杜尔。
Doil.

603
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:16,716
张主任和裴医生也是如此。
Chief Jang and Dr. Bae too.

604
00:40:20,678 --> 00:40:21,554
好的。
Okay.

605
00:40:21,637 --> 00:40:24,223
郑博士和恩塔克也是如此。
Dr. Jung and Euntak too.

606
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:29,687
你呢，徐宇镇医生？
And you, Dr. Seo Woojin?

607
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,280
发生了什么事？
What's going on?

608
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:44,618
在创伤中心准备好之前，我将与你分享这个办公室。
I'll be sharing this office with you
until the Trauma Center is ready.

609
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:48,414
我在问你为什么来多丹医院。
I'm asking why you came
to Doldam Hospital.

610
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:51,268
朴主任为我提供了创伤中心负责人的职位、
Director Park offered me the position
of the head of the Trauma Center,

611
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,960
而我接受了。
and I accepted.

612
00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:54,045
爸爸！
Dad!

613
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:57,673
你在医院里叫我爸爸可以吗？
Is it okay for you to call me Dad
in the hospital?

614
00:40:57,757 --> 00:41:00,551
如果你是创伤中心的负责人，那金师傅呢？
If you're the head of the Trauma Center,
what about Master Kim?

615
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:04,889
我是说，你为什么要辞去大学医院的工作？
I mean, why did you quit your job
at the university hospital?

616
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:06,223
为了什么？
What for?

617
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:09,643
我从今天的社会中得到了很多特权。
I've received much privilege
from today's society.

618
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,395
什么？
What?

619
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:15,149
由于这一点，我获得了荣誉，也受到了关注。
Thanks to that, I've received honor
and been in the limelight.

620
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:18,194
现在是我回报的时候了。
It's time for me to pay it back.

621
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:20,029
对社会而言、
For society,

622
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:24,367
我打算从这里开始承担起责任，履行我的职责。
I intend to take on responsibility
and perform my duties from here.

623
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,911
- 爸爸。- 而最重要的是、
- Dad.
- And most of all,

624
00:41:26,994 --> 00:41:28,496
我也想见见你。
I wanted to see you too.

625
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,510
我很抱歉，先生、
I'm sorry, sir,

626
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:47,181
但我不能同意你这次的决定。
but I can't agree
with your decision this time.

627
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,601
为什么不呢？你还需要更多的解释吗？
Why not? Do you still need
more of an explanation?

628
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:55,106
不，我理解你所说的一切。
No, I understood everything you said.

629
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:57,817
我只是...
I just…

630
00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:00,694
不能同意它。这就是全部。
can't agree with it. That's all.

631
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:03,322
我告诉过你。你不需要像这样保持警惕。
I told you. You don't need to keep
your guard up like that.

632
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:06,617
车振满教授是一位有经验的天才外科医生。
Professor Cha Jinman is a talented surgeon
who has experience in the field.

633
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,952
而有了这个机会、
And with this opportunity,

634
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,081
从局外人那里得到一个客观的评价不会是个坏主意。
it won't be a bad idea to get
an objective evaluation from an outsider.

635
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:14,708
你是唯一能评价我这个医生的人。
You're the only one
who can evaluate me as a doctor.

636
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:18,712
你也是唯一一个我想被承认为医生的人。
You're also the only one
I want to be recognized by as a doctor.

637
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:21,757
嘿，Woojin。
Hey, Woojin.

638
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:24,343
我不希望创伤中心没有你。
I don't want a trauma center without you.

639
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:29,348
如果你决定留在这里、
If you decide to stay here,

640
00:42:30,474 --> 00:42:31,725
我也会。
I will too.

641
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:55,332
我们可以谈一谈吗？
Can we talk for a minute?

642
00:43:01,714 --> 00:43:02,715
所以...
So…

643
00:43:03,424 --> 00:43:06,594
我的父亲将来到多尔丹医院。
My dad will be coming to Doldam Hospital.

644
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:09,096
我从金师傅那里听说了。
I heard from Master Kim.

645
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:11,974
哦，我明白了。
Oh, I see.

646
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:16,729
它是什么？
What is it?

647
00:43:16,812 --> 00:43:18,230
嗯？
Hm?

648
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:21,317
你有话要对我说。告诉我。
You have something
you want to say to me. Tell me.

649
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,320
嗯，问题是...
Well, the thing is…

650
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:32,578
我爸爸说他还没有找到住的地方，所以...
My dad says he hasn't found
a place to stay yet, so…

651
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:38,250
对不起，我们该怎么做？
Sorry, what do we do?

652
00:43:39,376 --> 00:43:41,629
我所有的东西怎么办？
What about all my stuff?

653
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:45,591
我们还没有拆开它们，所以它们还在箱子里。
We haven't unpacked them,
so they're still in boxes.

654
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:49,762
如果我说我有一个室友，他就不会进你的房间。
If I say that I have a roommate,
he won't go into your room.

655
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:54,558
在他几天后找到地方之前，能不能请你住在别的地方？
Could you please stay somewhere else
until he finds a place in a few days?

656
00:43:56,894 --> 00:44:00,731
我研究了一下，但公司的住房已经满了。
I looked into it,
but company housing is already full.

657
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,317
他说他要睡在一家旅馆里、
He said he would sleep at an inn,

658
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:05,819
但他必须一路走到镇上。
but he'd have to go all the way into town.

659
00:44:08,197 --> 00:44:11,700
我有一年没见到他了，所以我没有感到安心。
I haven't seen him in a year,
so I didn't feel at ease.

660
00:44:13,577 --> 00:44:15,955
好吧，我就留在医院里。
Okay, I'll stay at the hospital.

661
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:18,749
你没有生气，是吗？
You're not mad, are you?

662
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,375
一点也不。
Not at all.

663
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:22,920
谢谢。
Thanks.

664
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:29,343
- Eunjae。- 是吗？
- Eunjae.
- Yes?

665
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:30,970
他是你的父亲。
He's your dad.

666
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:32,888
而我是你的男人。
And I'm your man.

667
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:38,811
对你来说，问我也不必这么难，好吗？
It doesn't have to be so hard
for you to ask me, okay?

668
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
好的。
Okay.

669
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,109
不要被抓。
Don't get caught.

670
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:47,903
好吧，我不说了。
Okay, I won't.

671
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,950
对番茄汁的事感到抱歉。
Sorry about the tomato juice.

672
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:55,661
嘿，那个西红柿汁...
Hey, that tomato juice…

673
00:44:58,622 --> 00:44:59,623
好的。
Okay.

674
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:30,904
抵达多伦多医院教授公园
ARRIVED AT DOLDAMN HOSPITAL
PROFESSOR PARK

675
00:45:30,988 --> 00:45:34,867
一般来说，重要的是要把它做得很好。
Generally speaking,
it's important to make it down well.

676
00:45:38,996 --> 00:45:40,331
但这个该死的东西叫作自豪感
But this darn thing called pride

677
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:43,709
使得一个人表现得很小气。
makes a man act petty.

678
00:45:57,473 --> 00:45:59,558
- 他为什么要这样做？- 你在哪里？
- Why did he do that?
- Where are you?

679
00:45:59,642 --> 00:46:01,769
- 他在想什么？- 他在哪里？
- What was he thinking?
- Where is he?

680
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:03,603
我们来了!
We're coming!

681
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:04,980
- 快点！- 湘云！
- Hurry up!
- Sungyoon!

682
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:07,441
- 我认为这很严重。- 快点。
- I think it's serious.
- Hurry.

683
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:08,651
嘿，桑琼。
Hey, Sungyoon.

684
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,154
- 你还好吗？- 他的腿断了！
- Are you okay?
- His leg is broken!

685
00:46:13,322 --> 00:46:14,448
这种方式。
This way.

686
00:46:14,948 --> 00:46:16,075
- 湘云！- 教练！
- Sungyoon!
- Coach!

687
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,451
教练!
Coach!

688
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:20,704
- 快点！- 我们必须帮助他！
- Hurry up!
- We have to help him!

689
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:22,247
- 快点！- 哦，不。
- Hurry!
- Oh, no.

690
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,792
快点！教练！
Hurry! Coach!

691
00:46:29,213 --> 00:46:31,048
- 忍受吧。- 嘿，你打了911吗？
- Endure it.
- Hey, did you call 911?

692
00:46:34,218 --> 00:46:35,218
不要碰他。
Don't touch him.

693
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:46,355
你好，我在这里。
Hello, I'm here.

694
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:48,606
嗯？
Huh?

695
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,902
嘿，郑博士。我在这里。
Hey, Dr. Jung. I'm here.

696
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:53,529
嘿，尹阿雷姆博士。
Hey, Dr. Yoon Areum.

697
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:56,531
那么好吧。
All right then.

698
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,370
嗯？
Hm?

699
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,678
无论如何，这是金师傅的决定。
Anyway,
it was Master Kim's decision.

700
00:47:18,053 --> 00:47:20,222
查博士究竟是个什么样的人？
What kind of person is Dr. Cha exactly?

701
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:23,267
嗯，他在心胸外科方面相当有名。
Well, he was pretty well-known
in cardiothoracic surgery.

702
00:47:32,985 --> 00:47:34,027
嗯？
Huh?

703
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:37,740
尹医生。你来的真早。你今晚不是在值班吗？
Dr. Yoon. You're here early.
Aren't you on call tonight?

704
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:41,452
我有一些文件要看。但是，裴医生。
I had some papers to look over.
But, Dr. Bae.

705
00:47:42,286 --> 00:47:44,413
医院里的气氛怎么了？
What's with the mood in the hospital?

706
00:47:45,456 --> 00:47:46,498
哦。
Oh.

707
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:51,503
天哪，金师傅刚才引爆了一个巨大的炸弹。
Gosh, Master Kim set off
a massive bomb just now.

708
00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:56,632
五...
Five…

709
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:12,274
我可以帮你什么吗？
Can I help you with anything?

710
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:13,650
你在这里。
You're here.

711
00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:15,235
我听到了。
I heard.

712
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:18,822
显然，金师傅今天引爆了一枚核弹。
Apparently, Master Kim set off
a nuclear bomb today.

713
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,741
我知道。
I know.

714
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,701
他做到了。
He did.

715
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:27,080
我们该怎么做？感觉每个人都在精神崩溃。
What do we do? It feels like everyone
is having a mental breakdown.

716
00:48:28,248 --> 00:48:30,417
你还好吗，恩塔克？
Are you okay, Euntak?

717
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:32,920
这对我来说也是一种崩溃。
It was a breakdown for me too.

718
00:48:33,378 --> 00:48:35,130
但在听到金师傅的解释后、
But after hearing
Master Kim's explanation,

719
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,382
我理解他为什么要这样做。
I understood why he did what he did.

720
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,802
这一直是问题所在。
That's always the problem.

721
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,763
每当金师傅引爆炸弹、
Whenever Master Kim sets off a bomb,

722
00:48:43,722 --> 00:48:46,683
你想，"这有什么意义吗？"
you think, "Does this make any sense?"

723
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:49,603
但是，当你听他说完后，你总是能理解他。
But then when you hear him out,
you always understand him.

724
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:54,191
你有没有倒过时差？
Are you jet-lagged at all?

725
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,569
我很好。我在两天内就调整好了。
I'm fine. I adjusted within two days.

726
00:48:58,987 --> 00:48:59,987
哦，对了。
Oh, right.

727
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:02,533
在这里。
Here.

728
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:04,827
我在回来的路上在机场买的。
I bought it at the airport on my way back.

729
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,620
我错过了把它交给你的机会。
I missed the chance to give it to you.

730
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:15,963
因为你的手很珍贵。
Since your hands are precious.

731
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:21,510
我很想念你。
I missed you.

732
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:24,096
我们只分开了一个星期。
We were only apart for a week.

733
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:25,681
但你怎么能
But how could you

734
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:28,100
甚至不给我发一次短信？
not even text me once?

735
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:32,187
你去一个偏远地区做志愿者。
You went to volunteer in a remote area.

736
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:34,022
"我想你。"
"I miss you."

737
00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:35,399
"你什么时候回来？"
"When are you coming back?"

738
00:49:35,482 --> 00:49:36,483
"尽快回来。"
"Come back soon."

739
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:39,278
我看起来像是在发脾气。
I'd seem like I was throwing a fit.

740
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,697
这一直是问题所在。
That's always the problem.

741
00:49:42,656 --> 00:49:46,034
你想，"这有什么意义吗？"
You think, "Does this make any sense?"

742
00:49:46,785 --> 00:49:47,786
但是，当我听你说完、
But when I hear you out,

743
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:50,998
我总是理解你。
I always understand you.

744
00:49:56,628 --> 00:49:57,628
嗯!
Mm!

745
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:04,344
你说你想念我。
You said you missed me.

746
00:50:05,304 --> 00:50:07,389
我想看看你有多想念我。
I want to check how much you missed me.

747
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:08,472
嗯!
Mm!

748
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:11,852
我们在医院里，尹医生。
We're in the hospital, Dr. Yoon.

749
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:20,193
看到了吗？你并没有那么想我。
See? You didn't miss me that much.

750
00:50:46,303 --> 00:50:48,055
现在还剩下40分钟。
There are still 40 minutes left.

751
00:50:49,473 --> 00:50:50,641
什么？
What?

752
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:52,100
直到你下班。
Until you get off work.

753
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:55,646
尽管如此，我们今天下午的病人并不多。
Still, we didn't have
very many patients this afternoon.

754
00:50:58,148 --> 00:50:59,149
张博士。
Dr. Jang.

755
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:01,108
什么？
What?

756
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:04,529
我做错了什么吗？
Did I do something wrong?

757
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:08,075
它是什么？
What is it?

758
00:51:14,373 --> 00:51:15,999
是的，道达姆医院急诊室？
Yes, Doldam Hospital ER?

759
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:18,417
是的。
Yes.

760
00:51:19,086 --> 00:51:20,295
是的，知道了。

761
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:23,382
有人在滑雪时摔倒了。他们将在5分钟内到达这里。
Someone fell while skiing.
They'll be here in five minutes.

762
00:51:23,465 --> 00:51:24,465
什么？
What?

763
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:28,553
这让我很抓狂。
This is driving me nuts.

764
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,201
我们祝你健康
WE WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH

765
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:53,036
是什么样的病人？
What kind of patient is it?

766

有人在滑雪时又摔倒了。
Someone fell while skiing again.

767
00:51:55,247 --> 00:51:56,832
我们被告知这是个开放性骨折。
We were told it was an open fracture.

768
00:51:56,915 --> 00:51:59,795
下个月，在平昌将有一场世界锦标赛的比赛。
Next month, there's going to be

772
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:09,302

773
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:18,353
真是一群庸医！"！
What a bunch of quacks!

774
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:20,230
如果考试成绩没有问题，是不是就没事了？

if the exam results are fine?

775
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:22,232
我告诉你我很痛苦!
I'm telling you I'm in pain!

00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,941
你至少应该沿途解释一下。
You should at least explain things
along the way.

876
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:40,735
他必须知道自己在做什么才能跟上。
He has to know what he's doing
to follow along.

877
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:42,320
现在，病人是第一位的。
Right now, the patient comes first.

878
00:58:42,612 --> 00:58:44,656
没有时间去关注张东华的心情。
There's no time
to look out for Jang Donghwa's mood.

879
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:52,163
你有什么问题？你表现得不像你自己。
What's wrong with you?
You're not acting like yourself.

880
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:55,959
你为什么这么着急呢？
Why are you in such a rush?

881
00:58:57,043 --> 00:58:58,128
那个病人
That patient

882
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:00,213
是在国家队。
is on the national team.

883
00:59:02,632 --> 00:59:03,632
那么？
So?

884
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:05,718
他是今天早上的那个病人
He's the patient from this morning

885
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,847
我把他送走了，因为他假装疼痛。
that I sent away for faking his pains.

886
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:24,070
你真的可以接受拉米亚吗？
Are you really okay with ramyeon?

887
00:59:25,155 --> 00:59:27,699
我通常在外面吃饭或叫外卖。
I usually eat out or order in.

888
00:59:27,949 --> 00:59:29,868
我没有意识到我已经没有米了。
I didn't realize I was out of rice.

889
00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:32,402
外卖食品的味道也很好。
Delivery food tastes good too.

890
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:34,414
这很好。不要管我。
It's fine. Don't mind me.

891
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:36,833
我不是不喜欢拉米亚。
I don't dislike ramyeon.

892
00:59:39,752 --> 00:59:40,920
嗯。
Mm.

893
00:59:46,259 --> 00:59:47,259
是医院的问题吗？
Is it the hospital?

894
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,388
是的，他们认为是腘绳肌动脉断裂。
Yes. They think
it's a ruptured popliteal artery.

895
00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:51,681
开始行动。
Get going.

896
00:59:53,725 --> 00:59:56,436
完成后将碗留在水槽中即可。
Just leave the bowl in the sink
when you're done.

897
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:58,688
- 我回来后就洗碗。- 好的。
- I'll do the dishes when I get back.
- Okay.

898
01:00:02,192 --> 01:00:04,486
手术可能会迟到，所以不要等了。
The surgery might run late,
so don't wait up.

899
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:06,237
好的。
Okay.

900
01:00:48,404 --> 01:00:51,199
这是今天早上留下的西红柿。喝之前要摇匀。
IT'S THE TOMATOES LEFT FROM THIS MORNING.
SHAKE WELL BEFORE DRINKING.

901
01:01:59,809 --> 01:02:00,809
女更衣室
WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM

902
01:02:02,437 --> 01:02:04,063
嘿，李博士。你还在这里吗？
Hey, Dr. Lee. Are you still here?

903
01:02:04,647 --> 01:02:05,648
你要回家了吗？
Are you going home?

904
01:02:05,732 --> 01:02:08,860
我回家后回来做了一个紧急手术。
I went home and came back
for an emergency surgery.

905
01:02:08,943 --> 01:02:10,320
一个紧急手术？
An emergency surgery?

906
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:14,741
我也可以进入手术室吗？
May I also go into the OR?

907
01:02:17,368 --> 01:02:18,202
它是什么？
What is it?

908
01:02:18,286 --> 01:02:21,205
你能有多幸运？天哪。
How lucky can you get? Gosh.

909
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:23,541
这种罕见的情况究竟从何而来？
Where on earth did
this rarity come from?

910
01:02:24,042 --> 01:02:25,376
快点准备好。
Hurry up and get ready.

911
01:02:26,085 --> 01:02:27,962
我今天要给你一个教训。
I'll teach you a lesson today.

912
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:49,651
限制区手术室
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

913
01:03:03,915 --> 01:03:05,625
CT扫描似乎显示了损害
The CT scan seems to show damage

914
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,388
在胫骨前动脉和胫骨后动脉中
in the anterior
and posterior tibial artery

915
01:03:07,543 --> 01:03:09,743
在远端区域而不是腘绳肌动脉。
in the distalis region
rather than the popliteal artery.

916
01:03:10,546 --> 01:03:12,382
我们必须做一些探索、
We'll have to do some exploring,

917
01:03:12,465 --> 01:03:14,842
但从我在戴夹板时看到的情况来看、
but from what I saw
while putting on the splints,

918
01:03:15,635 --> 01:03:17,470
这似乎是深层的腓肠神经。
it seems to be the deep peroneal nerve.

919
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:22,737
Eunjae, 动脉吻合术怎么样了？
Eunjae, what about the artery anastomosis?

920
01:03:22,809 --> 01:03:24,602
它周围有很多组织损伤、
There's a lot of tissue damage around it,

921
01:03:24,686 --> 01:03:27,105
所以我正在考虑从另一侧进行GSV移植。
so I'm considering
a GSV graft from the other side.

922
01:03:27,188 --> 01:03:28,940
为了防止隔间综合症、
In order to prevent
compartment syndrome,

923
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,359
宗庆后也在考虑做筋膜切除术。
Munjeong is considering
a fasciotomy as well.

924
01:03:31,442 --> 01:03:33,194
你将如何处理腓肠神经？
What will you do about the peroneal nerve?

925
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:38,616
纱布。
Gauze.

926
01:03:43,496 --> 01:03:44,831
好的，Bovie。
Okay. Bovie.

927
01:03:51,796 --> 01:03:52,796
握住这里。
Hold here.

928
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:54,340
镊子。
Forceps.

929
01:03:56,718 --> 01:03:57,927
梅岑鲍姆剪刀。
Metzenbaum scissors.

930
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,433
对不起，先生。
Sorry, sir.

931
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:10,565
移除脾脏。
Remove the spleen.

932
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:17,113
纱布，请。
Gauze, please.

933
01:04:23,035 --> 01:04:24,203
缝合。
Suture.

934
01:04:33,171 --> 01:04:34,380
让金师傅接电话。
Get Master Kim on the line.

935
01:04:38,926 --> 01:04:40,303
主人、
Master,

936
01:04:40,386 --> 01:04:41,763
我们将在5分钟内完成缝合工作。
we'll finish suturing in five.

937
01:04:42,472 --> 01:04:43,752
我们会从神经外科开始吗？
Will we start with neurorrhaphy?

938
01:04:43,806 --> 01:04:45,850
你在说什么？动脉是第一位的。
What are you saying?
The arteries come first.

939
01:04:45,933 --> 01:04:47,268
他是国家队的一员。
He's on the national team.

940
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:50,813
如果我们不尽快缝合神经，他可能再也没有机会跳了。
If we don't stitch up the nerves soon,
he might never get to jump again.

941
01:04:50,897 --> 01:04:54,567
如果我们不尽快解决他的动脉问题，他可能会失去整条腿。
If we don't get to his arteries soon,
he might lose his whole leg.

942
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:56,151
主人。
Master.

943
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:05,869
主人。
Master.

944
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,215
削减。
Cut.

945
01:05:18,007 --> 01:05:20,009
张东华，你做闭合缝合。
Jang Donghwa, you do the closing sutures.

946
01:05:20,092 --> 01:05:21,092
三分钟之内。
Within three minutes.

947
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:26,974
张博士。
Dr. Jang.

948
01:05:33,022 --> 01:05:34,023
把它给我。
Give it to me.

949
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:36,859
主人。
Master.

950
01:05:36,943 --> 01:05:38,569
我们不能先做神经切断术吗？
Can't we do the neurorrhaphy first?

951
01:05:39,153 --> 01:05:40,154
徐武进。
Seo Woojin.

952
01:05:40,238 --> 01:05:42,883
如此严重的骨折意味着受伤部位的末端被压碎了。
A fracture this serious means
the end of the injury site is crushed.

953
01:05:42,907 --> 01:05:45,201
即使你在探索后做了神经外科手术、
Even if you do a neurorrhaphy
after exploring,

954
01:05:45,284 --> 01:05:48,371
存活率太低。我们不能推迟动脉吻合术。
the viability is too low.
We can't delay the artery anastomosis.

955
01:05:48,454 --> 01:05:50,289
如果他不能从神经损伤中恢复过来、
If he doesn't recover
from the nerve injury,

956
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:52,208
反正他的运动员生涯已经结束了。
his life as an athlete is over anyway.

957
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,460
不管怎么说，这都是对那个人的死刑判决。
Either way,
it's a death sentence for that man.

958
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:57,004
不过，宁可冒着风险、
Still, rather than taking a risk,

959
01:05:57,088 --> 01:05:59,632
我认为先做动脉手术是正确的，徐医生。
I think it's right to do
the arterial surgery first, Dr. Seo.

960
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:02,885
神经在受到伤害的那一刻就开始死亡。
Nerves start to die
the moment they sustain an injury.

961
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:05,409
那么尽快把它们缝合起来不是最好的吗？
Then isn't it best to stitch them
back up as soon as possible?

962
01:06:06,222 --> 01:06:09,100
金师傅。以你的速度，这是有可能的。
Master Kim.
With your speed, it's possible.

963
01:06:14,856 --> 01:06:16,023
主人。
Master.

964
01:06:16,524 --> 01:06:18,734
你为什么犹豫不决呢？
Why are you hesitating?

965
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:20,318
嗯？
Hm?

966
01:06:22,613 --> 01:06:24,740
所有手术都必须以病人的生命为优先。
All surgeries must prioritize
the patient's life.

967
01:06:24,824 --> 01:06:26,158
其次是病人的安全。
Next is the patient's safety.

968
01:06:26,868 --> 01:06:29,078
关于功能的决定排在最后。
Decisions on function come last.

969
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:32,039
这里的每个人都知道这一点。
Everyone in here knows that.

970
01:06:32,123 --> 01:06:33,416
那么你为什么要浪费时间呢？
So why are you wasting time?

971
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:36,210
你不是在思考
You're not thinking

972
01:06:37,295 --> 01:06:40,256
像个疯子一样先做神经外科手术，你呢？
of doing a neurorrhaphy first
like a madman, are you?

973
01:06:40,339 --> 01:06:44,385
我们正在考虑什么才是对这个病人最好的方法。
We're contemplating what would be
the best method for this patient.

974
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:46,345
那么你为什么要考虑这个问题呢？
So why are you contemplating that?

975
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,181
拯救他的命令已经确定。
The order to save him is already set.

976
01:06:49,265 --> 01:06:50,474
对那个病人来说、
To that patient,

977
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:53,477
他作为运动员的生命也岌岌可危。
his life as an athlete
is also on the line.

978
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:56,290
如果你错过了操作的时机，他将失去作为运动员的生命。
If you miss the timing to operate,
he will lose his life as an athlete

979
01:06:56,314 --> 01:06:57,148
以及他的腿。
as well as his leg.

980
01:06:57,231 --> 01:07:00,276
或者，他可能不会失去任何一个。
Or, he might not lose either one.

981
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,783
好的，吴女士。
All right, Ms. Oh.

982
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:10,328
你能检查一下病人的左脚的肤色吗？
Could you check the complexion
of the patient's left foot?

983
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:23,799
看起来不错，金师傅。
It's looking good, Master Kim.

984
01:07:28,262 --> 01:07:31,599
吴镇。你还需要多长时间才能完成关闭？
Woojin. How much longer do you need
to finish closing?

985
01:07:32,892 --> 01:07:34,101
张东华博士。
Dr. Jang Donghwa.

986
01:07:36,896 --> 01:07:37,896
我已经完成了。
I'm done.

987
01:07:38,814 --> 01:07:40,066
- 削减。- 削减。
- Cut.
- Cut.

988
01:07:41,692 --> 01:07:43,361
我们已经完成了关闭，金师傅。
We're done closing, Master Kim.

989
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:46,572
我们是先做动脉？还是做神经外科手术？
Are we doing the arteries first?
Or the neurorrhaphy?

990
01:07:59,168 --> 01:08:00,252
先做神经外科手术。
Neurorrhaphy first.

991
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,465
好的，先做神经切断术。
Okay, the neurorrhaphy first.

992
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:06,592
你不应该从病人的角度去看。
You shouldn't look
at the patient's perspective.

993
01:08:09,929 --> 01:08:12,223
你必须看一下症状，卜医生。
You must look at the symptoms, Dr. Bu.

994
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:15,601
这就是为什么我刚刚检查了他的症状。
That's why I just checked his symptoms.

995
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:18,729
你没听说他左脚的肤色恢复了吗？
Didn't you hear the complexion
in his left foot is back?

996
01:08:18,813 --> 01:08:19,939
这意味着
That means

997
01:08:20,022 --> 01:08:24,568
两条动脉中的一条还没有被损坏。而这意味着
one of the two arteries
hasn't been damaged. And that means

998
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:29,323
首先缝合神经不会有太大的风险。
it won't be too much of a risk
to stitch up the nerves first.

999
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:32,827
别这么外行。
Don't be such an amateur.

1000
01:08:35,371 --> 01:08:36,371
你是否变得生疏了？
Are you getting rusty?

1001
01:08:39,959 --> 01:08:42,003
天哪，他什么都知道。
Gosh, he knows everything.

1002
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:44,046
他甚至想到了这一点。
He even had that in mind.

1003
01:08:45,548 --> 01:08:46,590
我们进去吧，查医生。
Let's go in, Dr. Cha.

1004
01:08:48,426 --> 01:08:49,593
哦，好的。
Oh, okay.

1005
01:08:49,677 --> 01:08:50,761
车恩才、
Cha Eunjae,

1006
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:54,098
你是说你会去做那个手术吗？
are you saying
you will go into that surgery?

1007
01:08:54,682 --> 01:08:55,516
什么？
What?

1008
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:58,936
你会参加这种冲动和鲁莽的手术吗？
You will participate
in that impulsive and reckless surgery?

1009
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,312
这不是鲁莽。
It's not reckless.

1010
01:09:00,813 --> 01:09:03,190
他看到了我们看不到的东西。
He sees what we can't see.

1011
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:06,110
金师傅在处理创伤方面有很多经验。
Master Kim has a lot of experience
dealing with trauma.

1012
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:07,194
是的，这是正确的。
Yes, that's right.

1013
01:09:10,197 --> 01:09:11,365
不管它是谁、
Whoever it is,

1014
01:09:12,116 --> 01:09:14,910
无论他做什么或处于什么位置、
no matter what he does
or what position he is in,

1015
01:09:15,745 --> 01:09:17,288
他不去想别的事情。
he doesn't think about anything else.

1016
01:09:18,497 --> 01:09:20,499
他只是牢记一件事。
He just keeps one thing in mind.

1017
01:09:21,459 --> 01:09:22,460
拯救病人。
Save the patient.

1018
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:24,795
无论怎样，都要救治病人。
Save the patient, no matter what.

1019
01:09:26,589 --> 01:09:30,801
这是金师傅教给我们的第一课。
That was Master Kim's first lesson
that he taught us.

1020
