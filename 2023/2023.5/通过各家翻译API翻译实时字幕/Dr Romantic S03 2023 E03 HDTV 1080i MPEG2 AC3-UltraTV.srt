(DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3)

2
00:01:57,002 --> 00:02:01,923
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

3
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:16,229
<i>Generally speaking,
it's important to make it down well.</i>

4
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:18,982
<i>But this darn thing called pride</i>

5
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,901
<i>makes a man act petty.</i>

6
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:23,862
Look far ahead, got it?

7
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:26,281
<i>- Also…
- If you're going down anyway,</i>

8
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:29,701
<i>you might as well look cool doing it.
…loosen up a little!</i>

9
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:31,202
Put your goggles on!

10
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:35,707
<i>But greed and arrogance
make you try so hard.</i>

11
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,251
<i>- Only after you become a wreck…
- Got it?</i>

12
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:42,088
<i>…will you finally be able
to let it go.</i>

13
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,391
This wind…

14
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,352
Don't jump. No! Don't!

15
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:58,813
Don't jump, I tell you!

16
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,335
<i>Is there no way for a man</i>

17
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:22,962
<i>to look graceful</i>

18
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,173
<i>while falling?</i>

19
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:33,098
What do you mean by that?

20
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,058
There is only one condition
for me to join you.

21
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:39,896
You will remove Bu Yongju
from Doldam Hospital Trauma Center.

22
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:47,320
Can't we reach an agreement
with your salary or any other condition?

23
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,906
I'm not asking to make a deal,
Director Park.

24
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,077
Professor, we can't run the Trauma Center
without Master Kim.

25
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:56,121
<i>It's unimaginable.</i>

26
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:58,623
Then let's forget we ever discussed this.

27
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:09,592
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN

28
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,779
It's me.

29
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,824
When do you want to start?

30
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,242
When would you like me to start?

31
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,661
<i>How about in one week?</i>

32
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,497
<i>I'll talk to Master Kim by then.</i>

33
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:43,251
Of course, you will have to deal with
resistance from the other doctors.

34
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,211
I'm prepared to deal with that much.

35
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:48,590
And let me know about other details
before you start work.

36
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,091
Okay.

37
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,511
Yes. I'll see you then.

38
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:08,484
He says he'll do it.

39
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,283
Good work, Director Park.

40
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,202
- Master Kim.
- Yes?

41
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,163
May I ask you why?

42
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:22,916
Why did you make such a decision?

43
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,585
You determined that we need him

44
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:27,253
and wanted to bring him here.

45
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,966
Still, I didn't want the Trauma Center
without you there.

46
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,509
The Trauma Center…

47
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:37,805
had been a longtime dream of yours.

48
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,933
Taking that away would be cheating.

49
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,309
Director Park.

50
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:44,687
Do you know how to put
an elephant into a fridge?

51
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,107
The answer is simple.

52
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,151
Open the door.

53
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,820
Put the elephant inside.
Then, close the door.

54
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:54,906
Master Kim.

55
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,825
But just because something is simple

56
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,203
doesn't mean anyone can do it.

57
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:03,957
A simple solution doesn't make it easy.

58
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,714
You and I
have only just grabbed the doorknob.

59
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,279
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN!
GIVE ME AN ANSWER FOR MY SON'S DEATH!

60
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:51,337
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN!
GIVE ME AN ANSWER FOR MY SON'S DEATH!

61
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:02,140
(VOLUME 3)
PUTTING AN ELEPHANT IN A FRIDGE, PART 2

62
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,351
This is the Doldam Hospital ER.

63
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,187
Yes, got it.

64
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:11,190
Dr. Jang, an emergency patient
is arriving in three minutes.

65
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,818
Oh, okay. Can you bandage him up, please?

66
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,986
Yes, Doctor.

67
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:19,073
Oh, and you need to look at
the laceration wound in bed eight.

68
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:20,241
Laceration wound? Okay.

69
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:23,494
Dr. Jang, the X-ray is out
for the patient in bed two.

70
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:25,454
Okay.

71
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:29,857
Oh, what should we do
about the patient with the stomachache?

72
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:31,294
I'll do it.

73
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,546
Dr. Jang!
The laceration wound in bed eight.

74
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,341
- They've been waiting for a while.
- Okay.

75
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:38,217
Doctor, there's so much blood.

76
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,219
Doctor, please take a look here.

77
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:41,888
- Doctor.
- We were here first.

78
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:43,681
- But this is urgent.
- Doctor.

79
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:45,085
- Just a moment.
- Please help us.

80
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,226
- Doctor.
- We were here first.

81
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,186
- Doctor?
- Doctor!

82
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,354
- Excuse me.
- Doctor.

83
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:51,773
Are Dr. Jung Insu
and Yoon Areum not here yet?

84
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:54,108
Dr. Jung went to a meeting
with the director.

85
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,027
And Dr. Yoon hasn't come to work yet.

86
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:57,612
Seriously…

87
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,155
We have a patient!

88
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,657
There was a car crash.

89
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,869
A penetrating wound in the abdomen.
BP is 80/40. Heart rate 120.

90
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,668
His BP is too low.
What should we do, Dr. Jang?

91
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:15,588
Dr. Jang!
What about the stomachache patient?

92
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:18,257
Dr. Jang!
The laceration wound in bed eight!

93
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,134
- Dr. Jang!
- Dr. Jang!

94
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:21,636
Dr. Jang! Bed eight!

95
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,221
Wait… just a minute.

96
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:24,639
- Bed eight!
- What are you doing?

97
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:27,266
- Please come quickly!
- It's urgent!

98
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,394
- Dr. Jang!
- Dr. Jang!

99
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,479
Over here!

100
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:38,277
What are you doing right now?

101
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,071
Get a grip, punk!

102
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:48,371
WE WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH

103
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:59,799
He just fell asleep standing up, right?

104
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,717
I think he even had a dream.

105
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:06,639
You must be very tired, Dr. Jang.

106
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,433
Yes…

107
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:09,851
I'm okay.

108
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,148
It's an emergency patient!

109
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:24,449
It's a 26-year-old male.
He's on the national ski jump team.

110
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:27,160
He was injured
while making a landing during training.

111
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:28,995
His vitals are 126/82 and 68.

112
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,581
He doesn't seem to have
any external injuries,

113
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,144
but he's suffering from extreme pain.

114
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,419
- Let's get him in the hybrid OR.
- Okay.

115
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,297
Please wait here.

116
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Aren't you coming?

117
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:47,263
What about
Dr. Jung Insu and Dr. Yoon Areum?

118
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:49,223
Dr. Jung is in a meeting
with the director.

119
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:51,017
And Dr. Yoon hasn't come to work yet.

120
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:54,770
Dr. Jang.

121
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:56,063
Dr. Jang, hurry.

122
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:05,948
- Oh, you're here.
- Yes, hello.

123
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:10,077
Put that inside. No, not there. That's it.

124
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,581
Wait! That's new.
Make sure not to bump it.

125
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,542
- Yes, that's it.
- What are you doing?

126
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:19,295
Oh, Dr. Seo. Are you just coming to work?

127
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:21,881
A new CT surgical fellow
will be joining us today.

128
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:23,758
I've been rearranging for them.

129
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:26,469
Is Cha Eunjae moving to this room?

130
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:29,305
That's right. From now on,
general surgeons will be in one room,

131
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:30,788
and CT surgeons will be in another.

132
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,433
You will be with your own specialty.

133
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,479
But, why are there three desks?

134
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:40,942
I'm not sure. Director Park Minguk
asked me to prepare another.

135
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:44,111
Anyway, I can't believe
I get to witness this sight.

136
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:47,615
It seems only yesterday
we ran the hospital with just Master Kim.

137
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:51,285
Honestly, when Dr. Kang Dongju
and Dr. Yoon Seojeong joined us,

138
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,413
I never imagined that Master Kim's dream
would come true.

139
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:57,959
But one room is overflowing
with general surgeons,

140
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:00,753
and another room is full
of cardiothoracic surgeons.

141
00:11:00,836 --> 00:11:03,798
On top of that,
the Trauma Center is standing tall.

142
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:07,051
I am so deeply moved.

143
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,014
Hey, a man is talking.

144
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:14,392
Gosh, how could he be so lacking
in social skills?

145
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:16,936
My goodness! Sorry, go easy on that.

146
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,308
Hey, you're here.

147
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,582
- Did you work all night?
- Of course.

148
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:01,741
I was on call.
Of course I worked all night.

149
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,482
I couldn't sleep a wink.

150
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:04,859
Weren't you sleeping just now?

151
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,153
Sleeping? Who?

152
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,196
I wasn't sleeping.

153
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,162
I brought you some tomato juice.

154
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,414
I blanched them
before blending it.

155
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:19,832
It should taste okay.

156
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,417
You made it yourself?

157
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:24,670
- You even blanched them?
- Yes.

158
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,089
I even blanched them myself.

159
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:29,467
Hey, what is this?

160
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:33,262
You're quite moving
with just a few tomatoes.

161
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:38,809
While you're at it,
open the lid for me too. Please?

162
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,186
Pretty please?

163
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:50,404
Sorry, I'm still half asleep.

164
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:52,114
My tongue isn't completely awake yet.

165
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:55,116
Mmm!

166
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,412
This tastes good. It's so fresh.

167
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:02,541
Please forget what you just heard.
Can you do that?

168
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,127
No, I can't.

169
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:08,130
It was a momentary error
on my part because I was tired.

170
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:09,632
Please forget about it, okay?

171
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:10,715
I don't want to.

172
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:12,426
"Pretty please."

173
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,886
There you go again.

174
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:16,180
This one will last a while.
What? "Pretty please?"

175
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,682
Stop it, Seo Woojin.

176
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:18,766
- "Pretty please?"
- Hey.

177
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:20,184
- Pretty...
- Hush.

178
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:22,036
- Someone might hear.
- Okay, I'll stop.

179
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:25,439
- But "pretty please?" Okay, I'll stop.
- Seriously, I said stop.

180
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:36,367
Dr. Lee Seonung.
This is Dr. Seo Woojin in general surgery.

181
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,704
Hello. We met on the boat last time.

182
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:45,251
Oh, you must be the new CT surgery fellow.

183
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:46,836
I'm Lee Seonung.

184
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,839
As of today, I'm reporting to duty
at Doldam Hospital.

185
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,132
Master Kim hired me.

186
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,134
It's good to see you. I hope we get along.

187
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,468
Pretty please.

188
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:56,761
What?

189
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,894
It's a call from the ER.

190
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,689
See you later, Dr. Cha Eunjae.

191
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,733
Have a good day.

192
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,698
What did he just say?

193
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:17,575
Oh, don't mind him.

194
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,870
He's just like that sometimes.
He's not even funny, but he tries.

195
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:22,356
But he's not funny at all, right?

196
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,331
Gosh, seriously.

197
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:29,170
Do you like tomato juice?

198
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,254
Yes.

199
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:32,965
What do we have?

200
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:37,011
He's on the national ski jump team.
He was injured while landing.

201
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,930
Dr. Bae Munjeong
is looking at his knee ligaments.

202
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,349
But he keeps saying he has stomach pain.

203
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,684
- What about the CT?
- The CT…

204
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,104
The CT shows wall enhancement
in a part of the front abdomen.

205
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:48,981
I think we need to do
a surgical observation.

206
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:50,941
- Right here?
- Yes.

207
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:57,031
But in the back, the aeration looks good
and the size is small.

208
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:59,658
I think the enhancement is
just from the swollen bowels.

209
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,702
That's true, but…

210
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,749
- What about diarrhea?
- There is none.

211
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:08,709
- What about his labs?
- His WBC is 9,000.

212
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:10,252
Only his CRP is slightly elevated.

213
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,170
Physical condition?

214
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,005
There's some tenderness in the RLQ.

215
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,006
And there's no rebound?

216
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,925
It's not prominent.

217
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:17,968
It's either there or not.

218
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:19,678
What do you mean by not prominent?

219
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:22,139
The patient keeps saying it hurts.

220
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,600
- Where is the patient?
- In the hybrid OR.

221
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:32,650
There's nothing wrong
with the knee ligaments.

222
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,236
Right, I said the same thing,

223
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:37,404
but the patient keeps saying
that it hurts.

224
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,490
Excuse me.

225
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:43,160
He had surgery on his ACL three years ago.

226
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:46,121
Oh, but it seems fine now.

227
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,582
My stomach hurts so much.

228
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,335
Oh, my stomach. It's killing me.

229
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:54,713
Let me take a look.

230
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,632
Hey, Dr. Seo. You're here.

231
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,176
The patient keeps complaining
about stomach pain.

232
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,471
But there isn't anything in particular
in the CT scan.

233
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,018
Sir, excuse me for a minute.

234
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:09,895
Bring your knee up.

235
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,025
- Does it hurt if I press here?
- Yes.

236
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,902
What about this side?

237
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,445
Does the right side still hurt?

238
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:19,864
Yes, it does.

239
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:22,658
Let me look under your clothes.

240
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:26,912
What if I tap on it like this?

241
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:27,997
That hurts too.

242
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,748
Can you cough with some force?

243
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:37,608
Do you feel a ringing in your stomach?

244
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:38,841
Yes, I feel it.

245
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:43,888
Let's try a different position
and compare.

246
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,307
Lift your legs. Tighten your muscles.

247
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,475
Lift your head and look at your knees.

248
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:57,151
Which one hurts more? Earlier or now?

249
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:59,028
This hurts more.

250
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,157
Okay. You can relax now.

251
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:05,992
Jang Donghwa.

252
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:07,036
Yes?

253
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:09,413
Did you check for Carnett's sign?

254
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,873
I did…

255
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:12,836
Then why did you suggest
a surgical observation?

256
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,335
There's no muscle guarding at all.

257
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,130
Excuse me. What is it? Is something wrong?

258
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:21,675
It's nothing big. It's a common illness

259
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,259
called faking.

260
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:33,646
What is this?

261
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,273
Did you fall while landing on purpose?

262
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:38,984
No, I didn't. I really am hurting.

263
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:40,903
Why won't you believe me?

264
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:44,031
The orthopedic surgeon and I agree.

265
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:46,200
There is nothing wrong
with the exam results.

266
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:47,993
What a bunch of quacks!

267
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,995
Is it all fine
if the exam results are fine?

268
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,206
I'm telling you I'm in pain!

269
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,750
You pathetic fool!

270
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,419
The competition is days away.
What is this?

271
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:02,007
You wasted our time fussing over nothing,
at this ungodly hour!

272
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:04,051
I really was in pain!

273
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:07,388
Forget it, punk!
Why, I ought to rip you apart.

274
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:10,057
Sir, you can't speak so loudly here...

275
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,519
Do you think winning one gold medal
is a huge accomplishment?

276
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:16,397
Do you? Don't flatter yourself.

277
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,023
Got it?

278
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:21,568
A medal is just a tiny dot in your life.

279
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,655
All you did was put a dot on the map.

280
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,199
You're no big shot.

281
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:29,535
You're stiff with arrogance
and won't even practice.

282
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:30,828
And now, you fake an injury?

283
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,080
You…

284
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,980
Do you know what happens
if you get too stiff with arrogance?

285
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,794
Even the slightest error
can lead to a huge injury.

286
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:40,838
Got that?

287
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:43,007
A person's life is the same way.

288
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:44,675
Punk.

289
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:51,598
Gosh, I'm sorry.

290
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:58,856
What are you doing? Get up already!

291
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,747
Gosh, that coach is scary.

292
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,499
He must've faked it several times already.

293
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,420
Is it right to let him go?
He says he's in pain.

294
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:24,256
Still, there's nothing we can do.

295
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,342
That's what I think too.
I'm sure they have team doctors.

296
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:29,720
Let's just do what we can, Dr. Jung.

297
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,931
Okay, if that's what OS and GS say.

298
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:34,808
I'll discharge him for now.

299
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:44,692
Excuse me.

300
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,030
About Mr. Cho Sungyoon…

301
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,866
Couldn't we give him an IV
and let him rest for a few hours?

302
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,951
What does that mean?

303
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,204
Stress is a type of illness too.

304
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,332
He could get better
with a few days of rest.

305
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:01,627
Since when did GS surgeons
start to manage patients' stress levels?

306
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:03,753
Pardon?

307
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:08,050
Right, a doctor can feel sympathetic
for a patient.

308
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,677
But that's all.

309
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,306
You told me to do what I had to do.

310
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,603
I meant you should do your best
at your job.

311
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:21,563
What you just did is go overboard.

312
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,066
Don't confuse those two.

313
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:32,407
Seriously.

314
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,330
INFORMATION

315
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:40,165
<i>It must be
a lack of finesse, right?</i>

316
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,919
- Dr. Seo, I mean.
- Mm.

317
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:47,506
I think he says what he says
to teach Dr. Jang,

318
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:49,883
but Dr. Jang seems to be hurt
by his words.

319
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:55,681
I feel like I'm watching you
in your early days.

320
00:20:58,725 --> 00:20:59,726
Gosh.

321
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:03,522
Wasn't Yang Hojun in charge
of the residents?

322
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:05,566
Yes, he was supposed to be.

323
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,318
I'm sure he passed it on to Dr. Seo.

324
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,529
Anyway, he's the world's best

325
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:13,157
at being shameless
and having no sense of responsibility.

326
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:23,458
So…

327
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:27,087
can't you clear up some traffic
between those two?

328
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:30,215
Gosh, leave them alone.

329
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,677
If grown-ups butt in
for these things,

330
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,180
it will only make things more complicated.

331
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:40,475
They need to butt heads and bond over it.

332
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,936
That's how they'll grow up.

333
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:50,527
Dr. Jang Donghwa!

334
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:54,031
Suction for Mr. Kim Inguk.

335
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,494
Keep an eye on this patient
for the next hour.

336
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:13,889
He's a diabetic
with an intestinal obstruction.

337
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,207
How should you do a bowel rest?

338
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:18,013
He should take nothing by mouth
and give him an IV.

339
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:20,641
That's when he isn't diabetic.

340
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:22,726
A diabetic patient

341
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,061
could go into hypoglycemia.

342
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:25,864
So you should give him TPN,
not just fluids.

343
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:28,273
Oh, right.

344
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:55,884
If I catch you playing games
in the hospital again,

345
00:22:55,968 --> 00:22:57,427
you'll work two hours of overtime.

346
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:00,931
Try it if you want to.

347
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,603
JANG DONGHWA

348
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,029
Dr. Jang, have you checked
tomorrow's surgery schedule?

349
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:19,700
I'm on it now.

350
00:23:20,117 --> 00:23:21,118
Seriously.

351
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,993
Where is the report
on yesterday's abdomen injury patient?

352
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:36,717
I'll do it now.

353
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:55,861
Don't forget to organize
the case report by this afternoon.

354
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:57,487
Yes, sir.

355
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,530
Are you tired?

356
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,032
No, sir.

357
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,080
Yes, a bit.

358
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,082
That means you're doing well.

359
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,250
Here you go.

360
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:54,668
Yes, sir.

361
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,270
Oh, there you are.

362
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,439
Did you have surgery?

363
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,316
I had some practice to do.

364
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:19,069
I'm done now.

365
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,155
It's hard, isn't it?

366
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,659
Well, it's fine.

367
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:29,830
Take it easy.

368
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:32,374
Easy.

369
00:25:39,965 --> 00:25:42,008
<i>I'm betting that
he didn't understand.</i>

370
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:46,179
Do you think so?

371
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:49,641
Even for a cool-headed man,

372
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:54,271
being objective about himself
is not an easy thing, Master Kim.

373
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:02,696
By the way,
you said you wanted to tell me something.

374
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:04,990
What is it?

375
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
<i>What?</i>

376
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,412
A new head of the Trauma Center?

377
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,830
Who?

378
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,374
Well,

379
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:18,170
I'm not sure
if the rumors are true either.

380
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:23,425
I hear Dr. Cha Jinman will be coming
as head of the Trauma Center.

381
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:25,594
By Dr. Cha Jinman, do you mean…

382
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:28,221
Cha Eunjae's dad?

383
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:29,598
Yes.

384
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:46,072
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

385
00:26:49,326 --> 00:26:52,329
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

386
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:01,880
Wow!

387
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:05,091
How nice. This is perfect!

388
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:08,595
Great things are happening
now that I have a new junior.

389
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,973
Now, CT surgeons are
taking over Doldam Hospital.

390
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,225
Let's sweep the board, okay?

391
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:17,020
I'm lacking in practical experience.
I have a lot to learn.

392
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,607
Don't worry. Don't be nervous.

393
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,651
If you have any questions, ask me anytime.

394
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,277
And if you need any help, ask for it.

395
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:29,324
You'll catch on soon enough,
but everyone here at Doldam is nice.

396
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:31,535
Well…

397
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:35,205
Just watch out for Dr. Yang Hojun in GS.
He's not that great.

398
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:43,797
By the way, why are there three desks?

399
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,048
Oh…

400
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:46,758
I'm not sure.

401
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,094
No way.

402
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:54,015
With his skills and his name value,
it's not out of the question.

403
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:58,144
In fact,
we're gaining a lot from this, Ms. Oh.

404
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:02,257
Is it Director Park's doing again?

405
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,401
It is, right? He pressured you into this.

406
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:07,445
Gosh. No, it isn't.

407
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:10,323
What did he say this time
to get his own way?

408
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:13,451
Did he use the opening date against you?
Or the emergency helicopter?

409
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,370
What kind of excuse did he use

410
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:17,453
to steal the position of
head of the Trauma Center?

411
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,875
I didn't steal it from him, Ms. Oh.

412
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,837
I heard your voice from outside.

413
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:26,461
I didn't mean to,
but I overheard your conversation.

414
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:28,091
I'm glad you already heard me.

415
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:31,761
Tell me in person.

416
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,888
What kind of plot are you hiding

417
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:36,433
behind this ridiculous
personnel appointment?

418
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:37,976
There is no plot.

419
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:39,894
I'm upset, Ms. Oh.

420
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:43,648
I've been working with loyalty
and sincerity over the past three years.

421
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:46,651
Isn't this too absurd of a decision
to call it loyalty and sincerity?

422
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:49,395
How could you do that with
that position of all things?

423
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:53,158
How do you develop such random
and senseless creativity?

424
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:56,202
I told you it was my idea.

425
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:58,872
That's what I mean!
It was Master Kim's idea…

426
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:04,085
- What?
- I said we should do it.

427
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:06,379
- But…
- MINGUK: Look.

428
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:08,143
Let's clear up the misunderstanding later.

429
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:10,300
Let's go up to my office for now.

430
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:14,054
Professor Cha Jinman just arrived.

431
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,223
Let's do that.

432
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,935
Later.

433
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:23,229
- Let's talk later, Ms. Oh.
- But…

434
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,400
- Let's go.
- Okay.

435
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:31,988
But why?

436
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:34,574
Why on earth?

437
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:42,082
Then I'll leave you to talk.

438
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,924
I'm so grateful to have you here,
Professor Cha.

439
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:52,007
Welcome.

440
00:29:58,682 --> 00:29:59,599
Here.

441
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:02,811
I've come up with a list of doctors
to join the Trauma Center.

442
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:03,978
Ah, yes.

443
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:07,982
A few of them have given me
positive responses.

444
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:11,981
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER
RECOMMENDED DOCTOR LIST

445
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:16,658
The Doldam surgeons aren't on here.

446
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:21,538
I haven't been able
to confirm their skills yet.

447
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:24,666
You don't have to worry
about that.

448
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:28,378
The Doldam surgeons' specialty
is treating trauma patients.

449
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:30,880
Master Kim has focused on that area

450
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:33,550
and trained them to be a good team.

451
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:34,633
Director Park.

452
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:37,345
My standards of judging people

453
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:40,223
is quite different from Bu Yongju's.

454
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:44,269
My style of teaching
should differ greatly as well.

455
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:45,895
No way.

456
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:50,233
You don't mean you will exclude surgeons
from Doldam because of me, right?

457
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,319
I mean we can't give Doldam surgeons
any special treatment.

458
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,072
This center runs on government funding.

459
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:58,283
The rules must be fair.

460
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:01,578
Besides, skill may be important
in treating trauma,

461
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:04,122
but so is teamwork.

462
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,915
You said you'd judge fairly
based on skill.

463
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:09,753
But it sounds to me that you will have
very personal standards.

464
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:15,383
To be honest, it's obvious
how they'd be if they learned from you.

465
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:18,303
They will be reckless, insolent,

466
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,389
or happy to wield a scalpel
out of arrogance.

467
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:22,599
People like that.

468
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:24,100
You like kids like that.

469
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:28,646
I do favor doctors
who do what they must for patients.

470
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,317
And if they have good hands, even better.

471
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,195
A good hand doesn't always
make a good doctor.

472
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:36,362
Exactly.

473
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,200
Just like how good test scores
don't make good doctors either.

474
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:51,544
Well…

475
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:55,423
I don't think we can decide on
personnel matters right now.

476
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,258
Are you so confident?

477
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:04,891
If I weren't confident,

478
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,851
would I have set up this meeting?

479
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:10,355
I'm sure you know that my standards

480
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:12,982
are very picky and conservative.

481
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:16,569
I do remember that you frustrated me with
your narrow-minded and stubborn nature.

482
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:21,658
Well, we still have some time
until the Trauma Center opens.

483
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:23,034
So, in due time…

484
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:24,327
Let's do it, then.

485
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,080
Let's see how good Doldam's surgeons are.

486
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,541
It would be better
if you operate yourself.

487
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:33,670
I want to see how good you are
since it's been so long.

488
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:38,508
I wonder how much your skills
have improved over the years.

489
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:40,802
- You're not drinking this, are you?
- Master Kim.

490
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:43,429
I wonder

491
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:46,015
if you've gotten rusty at all.

492
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:00,405
Let's discuss personnel matters
in due time.

493
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:03,116
I'll show you the room
that you will be using, Professor Cha.

494
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:05,535
Room?

495
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:09,497
I'll show you the way.

496
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:11,415
Let's go.

497
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,002
Professor Cha?

498
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:26,890
Will you really be okay?

499
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,473
Don't ask.

500
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:33,104
I was just regretting this decision
for about three seconds.

501
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:36,482
He hasn't signed the contract yet.

502
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:38,943
It's not too late to tell me
if you've changed your mind.

503
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:43,990
We can't end things
before we even open the door.

504
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:47,285
So ultimately,
you really will enter this narrow door?

505
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:48,620
If you pick up a sword,

506
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:51,456
the least you can do is unsheathe it.

507
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,707
Okay.

508
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,711
Remember.
That was the last chance I gave you.

509
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,772
When I first saw you
in the Trauma Center,

510
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:16,940
you were like the Avengers.

511
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:18,942
- Seriously.
- The Avengers? Don't flatter me.

512
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:21,110
Anyway,
I'm honored to work with you.

513
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:22,028
Honored?

514
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:24,197
Dr. Lee, you use such sweet words.
You're honored.

515
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,865
I really think you're impressive.

516
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:29,410
Totally understandable.
I know we surgeons are pretty impressive.

517
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,870
Mmm!

518
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:34,457
Dr. Lee, you're our lucky charm.

519
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:36,584
Did you blend this yourself? Gosh.

520
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:38,753
I didn't make it, but it's good, right?

521
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:39,879
Mmm!

522
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,844
What is it, Dr. Seo?

523
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:48,972
This is the CS room.
Knock before you come in.

524
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:57,063
Dr. Lee.

525
00:34:57,605 --> 00:34:59,107
Have you been to the ER yet?

526
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:02,360
Do you want to look around
and say hi to the ER folks?

527
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,450
Why? Do you have something
to tell me, Dr. Seo?

528
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:11,869
Don't you think you have something
to tell me, Dr. Cha?

529
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:14,455
Later.

530
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:16,916
Let's talk later.

531
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:20,753
I have something to do
with Dr. Lee right now.

532
00:35:20,837 --> 00:35:23,131
Dr. Lee, could you give us the room
for a moment?

533
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:24,979
I have something to discuss with Dr. Cha.

534
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:26,384
Yes, of course.

535
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,467
No, Dr. Lee!

536
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:30,430
- There's no need to leave.
- Okay.

537
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:31,889
I just need five minutes, Dr. Lee.

538
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:33,725
Oh, okay.

539
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:36,019
Dr. Lee, you only need to listen
to a fellow CT surgeon.

540
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:38,145
Dr. Lee.

541
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,357
Come on, I'm sure you misheard something.

542
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:26,569
The Trauma Center of all places?
That place is Master Kim's...

543
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,488
I heard it from Master Kim himself.

544
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:30,990
I know. So Master… What?

545
00:36:31,074 --> 00:36:33,242
Why did he make that decision
all of a sudden?

546
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:36,037
If Director Park didn't pressure him,

547
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,456
and he made this decision himself,

548
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:40,625
it's even more of a mystery.

549
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,709
Perhaps,

550
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,260
could it be because
of his multiple sclerosis?

551
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,050
His symptoms might have gotten worse
without our knowing.

552
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:51,636
Come on, there's no way.

553
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,971
He's been going fishing on his days off,

554
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:56,349
getting plenty of fresh air and exercise.

555
00:36:56,432 --> 00:36:58,726
He's been working hard
to keep up his health.

556
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,188
Right, when we did some bloodwork
and a few other tests last month,

557
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:03,648
all his results were okay.

558
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:06,484
Right, I doubt that's what it is, Ms. Oh.

559
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:10,822
If that's not it,
I just don't understand it at all.

560
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,802
What are you doing here?

561
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,102
I need an explanation, sir.

562
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:42,686
What?

563
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:53,822
Gosh.

564
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:00,663
First of all, Master Kim.

565
00:38:01,164 --> 00:38:03,332
Cha Jinman as head of the Trauma Center?

566
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,626
Is there

567
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,462
some other reason that we don't know of?

568
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:12,967
If not, I just don't get it.

569
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,468
No, Ms. Oh.

570
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:18,973
That position should be open
to anyone capable,

571
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:22,059
even if that isn't me.

572
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,313
Saying that
you can't understand that

573
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:28,274
is a dangerous thought.

574
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:31,986
I know.

575
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,490
We've all been working very hard
for the Trauma Center.

576
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,702
And if not
for your efforts and dedication,

577
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,621
we wouldn't have gotten this far.

578
00:38:41,704 --> 00:38:45,249
But effort and dedication

579
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,793
should be left behind
the moment you've given them.

580
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:50,171
Hoping for some kind of payment

581
00:38:50,254 --> 00:38:52,215
or demanding recognition of your input,

582
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:56,302
things will turn into
a muddy mess in a flash.

583
00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:57,886
But,

584
00:38:58,221 --> 00:39:02,266
the head of the Trauma Center
should be the leader who will take charge.

585
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,685
That position should be filled

586
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,688
after more careful
and meticulous consideration.

587
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,405
If all of you keep working hard

588
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,699
in your respective positions,

589
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:22,370
nothing drastic will happen
just because we hired someone

590
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:25,248
from the outside
to be the new head of the Trauma Center.

591
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:28,833
My goodness.

592
00:39:29,377 --> 00:39:30,711
I know.

593
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:34,924
This will be a test for us too.

594
00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:36,007
However,

595
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:41,097
we will have more trauma patients
once we open,

596
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,433
then we'll need more doctors.

597
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,561
Without accepting new doctors,

598
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,398
how much longer do you think
we can hold out?

599
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:54,235
So please,

600
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:56,988
accept my decision without any bias.

601
00:39:58,072 --> 00:39:59,657
Okay, Ms. Oh?

602
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,370
Doil.

603
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:16,716
Chief Jang and Dr. Bae too.

604
00:40:20,678 --> 00:40:21,554
Okay.

605
00:40:21,637 --> 00:40:24,223
Dr. Jung and Euntak too.

606
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:29,687
And you, Dr. Seo Woojin?

607
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,280
What's going on?

608
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:44,618
I'll be sharing this office with you
until the Trauma Center is ready.

609
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:48,414
I'm asking why you came
to Doldam Hospital.

610
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:51,268
Director Park offered me the position
of the head of the Trauma Center,

611
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,960
and I accepted.

612
00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:54,045
Dad!

613
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:57,673
Is it okay for you to call me Dad
in the hospital?

614
00:40:57,757 --> 00:41:00,551
If you're the head of the Trauma Center,
what about Master Kim?

615
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:04,889
I mean, why did you quit your job
at the university hospital?

616
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:06,223
What for?

617
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:09,643
I've received much privilege
from today's society.

618
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,395
What?

619
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:15,149
Thanks to that, I've received honor
and been in the limelight.

620
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:18,194
It's time for me to pay it back.

621
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:20,029
For society,

622
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:24,367
I intend to take on responsibility
and perform my duties from here.

623
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,911
- Dad.
- And most of all,

624
00:41:26,994 --> 00:41:28,496
I wanted to see you too.

625
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,510
I'm sorry, sir,

626
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:47,181
but I can't agree
with your decision this time.

627
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,601
Why not? Do you still need
more of an explanation?

628
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:55,106
No, I understood everything you said.

629
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:57,817
I just…

630
00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:00,694
can't agree with it. That's all.

631
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:03,322
I told you. You don't need to keep
your guard up like that.

632
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:06,617
Professor Cha Jinman is a talented surgeon
who has experience in the field.

633
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,952
And with this opportunity,

634
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,081
it won't be a bad idea to get
an objective evaluation from an outsider.

635
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:14,708
You're the only one
who can evaluate me as a doctor.

636
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:18,712
You're also the only one
I want to be recognized by as a doctor.

637
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:21,757
Hey, Woojin.

638
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:24,343
I don't want a trauma center without you.

639
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:29,348
If you decide to stay here,

640
00:42:30,474 --> 00:42:31,725
I will too.

641
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:55,332
Can we talk for a minute?

642
00:43:01,714 --> 00:43:02,715
So…

643
00:43:03,424 --> 00:43:06,594
My dad will be coming to Doldam Hospital.

644
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:09,096
I heard from Master Kim.

645
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:11,974
Oh, I see.

646
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:16,729
What is it?

647
00:43:16,812 --> 00:43:18,230
Hm?

648
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:21,317
You have something
you want to say to me. Tell me.

649
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,320
Well, the thing is…

650
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:32,578
My dad says he hasn't found
a place to stay yet, so…

651
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:38,250
Sorry, what do we do?

652
00:43:39,376 --> 00:43:41,629
What about all my stuff?

653
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:45,591
We haven't unpacked them,
so they're still in boxes.

654
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:49,762
If I say that I have a roommate,
he won't go into your room.

655
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:54,558
Could you please stay somewhere else
until he finds a place in a few days?

656
00:43:56,894 --> 00:44:00,731
I looked into it,
but company housing is already full.

657
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,317
He said he would sleep at an inn,

658
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:05,819
but he'd have to go all the way into town.

659
00:44:08,197 --> 00:44:11,700
I haven't seen him in a year,
so I didn't feel at ease.

660
00:44:13,577 --> 00:44:15,955
Okay, I'll stay at the hospital.

661
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:18,749
You're not mad, are you?

662
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,375
Not at all.

663
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:22,920
Thanks.

664
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:29,343
- Eunjae.
- Yes?

665
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:30,970
He's your dad.

666
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:32,888
And I'm your man.

667
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:38,811
It doesn't have to be so hard
for you to ask me, okay?

668
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Okay.

669
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,109
Don't get caught.

670
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:47,903
Okay, I won't.

671
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,950
Sorry about the tomato juice.

672
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:55,661
Hey, that tomato juice…

673
00:44:58,622 --> 00:44:59,623
Okay.

674
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:30,904
ARRIVED AT DOLDAMN HOSPITAL
PROFESSOR PARK

675
00:45:30,988 --> 00:45:34,867
<i>Generally speaking,
it's important to make it down well.</i>

676
00:45:38,996 --> 00:45:40,331
<i>But this darn thing called pride</i>

677
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:43,709
<i>makes a man act petty.</i>

678
00:45:57,473 --> 00:45:59,558
- Why did he do that?
- Where are you?

679
00:45:59,642 --> 00:46:01,769
- What was he thinking?
- Where is he?

680
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:03,603
We're coming!

681
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:04,980
- Hurry up!
- Sungyoon!

682
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:07,441
- I think it's serious.
- Hurry.

683
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:08,651
Hey, Sungyoon.

684
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,154
- Are you okay?
- His leg is broken!

685
00:46:13,322 --> 00:46:14,448
This way.

686
00:46:14,948 --> 00:46:16,075
- Sungyoon!
- Coach!

687
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,451
Coach!

688
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:20,704
- Hurry up!
- We have to help him!

689
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:22,247
- Hurry!
- Oh, no.

690
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,792
Hurry! Coach!

691
00:46:29,213 --> 00:46:31,048
- Endure it.
- Hey, did you call 911?

692
00:46:34,218 --> 00:46:35,218
Don't touch him.

693
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:46,355
Hello, I'm here.

694
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:48,606
Huh?

695
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,902
Hey, Dr. Jung. I'm here.

696
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:53,529
Hey, Dr. Yoon Areum.

697
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:56,531
All right then.

698
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,370
Hm?

699
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,678
Anyway,
it was Master Kim's decision.

700
00:47:18,053 --> 00:47:20,222
What kind of person is Dr. Cha exactly?

701
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:23,267
Well, he was pretty well-known
in cardiothoracic surgery.

702
00:47:32,985 --> 00:47:34,027
Huh?

703
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:37,740
Dr. Yoon. You're here early.
Aren't you on call tonight?

704
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:41,452
I had some papers to look over.
But, Dr. Bae.

705
00:47:42,286 --> 00:47:44,413
What's with the mood in the hospital?

706
00:47:45,456 --> 00:47:46,498
Oh.

707
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:51,503
Gosh, Master Kim set off
a massive bomb just now.

708
00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:56,632
Five…

709
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:12,274
Can I help you with anything?

710
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:13,650
You're here.

711
00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:15,235
I heard.

712
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:18,822
Apparently, Master Kim set off
a nuclear bomb today.

713
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,741
I know.

714
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,701
He did.

715
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:27,080
What do we do? It feels like everyone
is having a mental breakdown.

716
00:48:28,248 --> 00:48:30,417
Are you okay, Euntak?

717
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:32,920
It was a breakdown for me too.

718
00:48:33,378 --> 00:48:35,130
But after hearing
Master Kim's explanation,

719
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,382
I understood why he did what he did.

720
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,802
That's always the problem.

721
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,763
Whenever Master Kim sets off a bomb,

722
00:48:43,722 --> 00:48:46,683
you think, "Does this make any sense?"

723
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:49,603
But then when you hear him out,
you always understand him.

724
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:54,191
Are you jet-lagged at all?

725
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,569
I'm fine. I adjusted within two days.

726
00:48:58,987 --> 00:48:59,987
Oh, right.

727
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:02,533
Here.

728
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:04,827
I bought it at the airport on my way back.

729
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,620
I missed the chance to give it to you.

730
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:15,963
Since your hands are precious.

731
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:21,510
I missed you.

732
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:24,096
We were only apart for a week.

733
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:25,681
But how could you

734
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:28,100
not even text me once?

735
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:32,187
You went to volunteer in a remote area.

736
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:34,022
"I miss you."

737
00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:35,399
"When are you coming back?"

738
00:49:35,482 --> 00:49:36,483
"Come back soon."

739
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:39,278
I'd seem like I was throwing a fit.

740
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,697
That's always the problem.

741
00:49:42,656 --> 00:49:46,034
You think, "Does this make any sense?"

742
00:49:46,785 --> 00:49:47,786
But when I hear you out,

743
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:50,998
I always understand you.

744
00:49:56,628 --> 00:49:57,628
Mm!

745
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:04,344
You said you missed me.

746
00:50:05,304 --> 00:50:07,389
I want to check how much you missed me.

747
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:08,472
Mm!

748
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:11,852
We're in the hospital, Dr. Yoon.

749
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:20,193
See? You didn't miss me that much.

750
00:50:46,303 --> 00:50:48,055
There are still 40 minutes left.

751
00:50:49,473 --> 00:50:50,641
What?

752
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:52,100
Until you get off work.

753
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:55,646
Still, we didn't have
very many patients this afternoon.

754
00:50:58,148 --> 00:50:59,149
Dr. Jang.

755
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:01,108
What?

756
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:04,529
Did I do something wrong?

757
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:08,075
What is it?

758
00:51:14,373 --> 00:51:15,999
Yes, Doldam Hospital ER?

759
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:18,417
Yes.

760
00:51:19,086 --> 00:51:20,295
Yes, got it.

761
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:23,382
Someone fell while skiing.
They'll be here in five minutes.

762
00:51:23,465 --> 00:51:24,465
What?

763
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:28,553
This is driving me nuts.

764
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,201
WE WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH

765
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:53,036
What kind of patient is it?

766
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,122
Someone fell while skiing again.

767
00:51:55,247 --> 00:51:56,832
We were told it was an open fracture.

768
00:51:56,915 --> 00:51:59,795
Next month, there's going to be
a World Championship game in Pyeongchang.

769
00:51:59,835 --> 00:52:03,171
We'll probably keep seeing patients
who get injured while training.

770
00:52:03,255 --> 00:52:04,715
Emergency patient!

771
00:52:05,674 --> 00:52:07,676
- Sungyoon.
- Hey, hang in there.

772
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:09,302
- Sungyoon!
- We're at the hospital.

773
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:18,353
What a bunch of quacks!

774
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:20,230
Is it all fine
if the exam results are fine?

775
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:22,232
I'm telling you I'm in pain!

776
00:52:23,775 --> 00:52:24,860
What?

777
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:31,283
To the hybrid OR! Now!

778
00:52:31,908 --> 00:52:32,908
Please.

779
00:52:32,993 --> 00:52:33,994
This way.

780
00:52:35,078 --> 00:52:36,830
- The middle bed!
- This way!

781
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:38,164
Sir.

782
00:52:38,874 --> 00:52:41,251
- Be careful.
- Please wait outside.

783
00:52:45,213 --> 00:52:46,213
Dr. Seo!

784
00:52:52,804 --> 00:52:53,847
- Sir!
- It's his leg.

785
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,599
Let's lift him up. One, two.

786
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:56,683
Be careful.

787
00:52:57,142 --> 00:52:58,142
Okay.

788
00:53:07,944 --> 00:53:10,530
Just a second, Dad. One second.

789
00:53:11,156 --> 00:53:12,156
One second…

790
00:53:15,786 --> 00:53:17,871
Just a second, Dad!

791
00:53:19,831 --> 00:53:21,083
Just a second.

792
00:53:28,298 --> 00:53:29,298
It's my laundry.

793
00:53:32,511 --> 00:53:33,887
Just a second.

794
00:53:36,515 --> 00:53:37,849
Come in, Dad.

795
00:53:45,524 --> 00:53:46,900
It's nice and cozy.

796
00:53:48,235 --> 00:53:49,444
Do you live here alone?

797
00:53:50,195 --> 00:53:52,197
No, I have a roommate.

798
00:53:52,948 --> 00:53:55,668
I mentioned you were coming,
so my friend is staying at the hospital.

799
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,743
The hospital?

800
00:53:57,536 --> 00:53:58,578
Your roommate is a doctor?

801
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:00,288
What?

802
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:02,332
Yes, well…

803
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:05,168
It's Dr. Yoon Areum at Doldam Hospital.

804
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:06,753
She's an emergency medicine doctor.

805
00:54:10,924 --> 00:54:14,052
My room is this way.
You can leave your stuff here.

806
00:54:14,136 --> 00:54:15,136
I'll do it.

807
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,939
Start two IV lines, and start
hydration with 500cc of warm saline.

808
00:54:26,022 --> 00:54:27,899
Get two emergency pack RBCs.

809
00:54:27,983 --> 00:54:30,777
And prepare ten RBCs and eight FFPs.

810
00:54:30,861 --> 00:54:32,028
Yes, Doctor.

811
00:54:32,112 --> 00:54:34,239
Dr. Seo, have you found
the bleeding focus?

812
00:54:34,322 --> 00:54:35,407
It's hemoperitoneum.

813
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:37,367
Jang Donghwa, open that side up.

814
00:54:42,038 --> 00:54:43,415
Open it up all the way!

815
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:48,879
It's his spleen.

816
00:54:49,629 --> 00:54:51,548
Dr. Jung, BP is 80 over 40.

817
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:53,758
- Prepare the RIS!
- Yes, Doctor.

818
00:54:53,842 --> 00:54:55,510
Areum, get the labs started.

819
00:54:55,594 --> 00:54:56,761
Okay, I'll get it ready.

820
00:54:58,096 --> 00:54:59,514
His pulse is really weak.

821
00:55:00,015 --> 00:55:01,558
He might have a vessel injury too.

822
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:02,893
The popliteal artery?

823
00:55:02,976 --> 00:55:03,977
Yes, it could be.

824
00:55:04,895 --> 00:55:06,104
Was there any pumping?

825
00:55:06,188 --> 00:55:08,231
No, there wasn't any at the scene.

826
00:55:08,815 --> 00:55:11,610
Ms. Eom, ask Dr. Nam to open up an OR.

827
00:55:11,693 --> 00:55:13,737
- And call Dr. Cha Eunjae.
- Yes, Doctor.

828
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,488
Let's get a temporary splint on here.

829
00:55:15,572 --> 00:55:18,325
- Dr. Jung, see him through sedation.
- Okay.

830
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:19,284
Euntak.

831
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:20,535
I'll get it ready.

832
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:22,913
- Let's get him intubated.
- Yes, Doctor.

833
00:55:22,996 --> 00:55:24,789
Jang Donghwa, you assist.

834
00:55:25,832 --> 00:55:26,958
What?

835
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,551
Jang Donghwa, stop dawdling!

836
00:55:38,553 --> 00:55:40,388
Get your scrubs on. Hurry.

837
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:48,605
Excuse me. Coming through.

838
00:55:50,732 --> 00:55:51,816
What's going on?

839
00:55:52,317 --> 00:55:53,485
Is it an emergency patient?

840
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,946
Well, maybe? I think so.

841
00:56:00,075 --> 00:56:01,826
Let's begin. Scalpel.

842
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:04,412
But sir, this is the ER.

843
00:56:04,496 --> 00:56:06,456
Prepare a lot of gauze
for the bleeding.

844
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:07,539
Yes, Doctor.

845
00:56:16,216 --> 00:56:17,384
Bovie.

846
00:56:23,974 --> 00:56:25,725
Suction! Large tape!

847
00:56:34,401 --> 00:56:35,652
Richardson.

848
00:56:36,653 --> 00:56:37,653
Forceps.

849
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:41,032
Suction.

850
00:56:41,157 --> 00:56:42,157
I said, suction!

851
00:56:53,545 --> 00:56:55,505
Don't touch that.
You're crushing the pancreas.

852
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:57,090
Oh, okay.

853
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:00,927
Euntak, switch with Jang Donghwa.

854
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:16,650
Clamp.

855
00:57:18,236 --> 00:57:19,237
Another one here.

856
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:24,117
Tie, please.

857
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:32,709
Cut.

858
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:33,793
Cut.

859
00:57:33,877 --> 00:57:34,877
Another.

860
00:57:36,004 --> 00:57:37,684
We'll temporarily hold the splenic artery,

861
00:57:37,714 --> 00:57:39,924
pack it with gauze, get a CT,
and get him to the OR.

862
00:57:40,216 --> 00:57:41,259
- Cut.
- Cut.

863
00:57:41,426 --> 00:57:42,802
- Get me a cover.
- Okay.

864
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,936
We're moving the patient.

865
00:58:08,036 --> 00:58:09,204
What are you doing?

866
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:10,330
Are you here to have fun?

867
00:58:10,872 --> 00:58:12,975
What are you doing,
just standing around and watching?

868
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:15,168
I'm sorry, I was so dumbstruck.

869
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:17,796
Get your act together fast
and run over to the OR.

870
00:58:18,296 --> 00:58:20,006
We're starting a splenectomy right away.

871
00:58:20,382 --> 00:58:21,383
Get ready quickly.

872
00:58:24,302 --> 00:58:25,595
Get a move on!

873
00:58:31,935 --> 00:58:33,019
Dr. Seo.

874
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,897
Jang Donghwa is
a third-year resident.

875
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,941
You should at least explain things
along the way.

876
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:40,735
He has to know what he's doing
to follow along.

877
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:42,320
Right now, the patient comes first.

878
00:58:42,612 --> 00:58:44,656
There's no time
to look out for Jang Donghwa's mood.

879
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:52,163
What's wrong with you?
You're not acting like yourself.

880
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:55,959
Why are you in such a rush?

881
00:58:57,043 --> 00:58:58,128
That patient

882
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:00,213
is on the national team.

883
00:59:02,632 --> 00:59:03,632
So?

884
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:05,718
He's the patient from this morning

885
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,847
that I sent away for faking his pains.

886
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:24,070
<i>Are you really okay with ramyeon?</i>

887
00:59:25,155 --> 00:59:27,699
I usually eat out or order in.

888
00:59:27,949 --> 00:59:29,868
I didn't realize I was out of rice.

889
00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:32,402
Delivery food tastes good too.

890
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:34,414
It's fine. Don't mind me.

891
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:36,833
<i>I don't dislike ramyeon.</i>

892
00:59:39,752 --> 00:59:40,920
Mm.

893
00:59:46,259 --> 00:59:47,259
Is it the hospital?

894
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,388
Yes. They think
it's a ruptured popliteal artery.

895
00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:51,681
Get going.

896
00:59:53,725 --> 00:59:56,436
Just leave the bowl in the sink
when you're done.

897
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:58,688
- I'll do the dishes when I get back.
- Okay.

898
01:00:02,192 --> 01:00:04,486
The surgery might run late,
so don't wait up.

899
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:06,237
Okay.

900
01:00:48,404 --> 01:00:51,199
IT'S THE TOMATOES LEFT FROM THIS MORNING.
SHAKE WELL BEFORE DRINKING.

901
01:01:59,809 --> 01:02:00,809
WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM

902
01:02:02,437 --> 01:02:04,063
Hey, Dr. Lee. Are you still here?

903
01:02:04,647 --> 01:02:05,648
Are you going home?

904
01:02:05,732 --> 01:02:08,860
I went home and came back
for an emergency surgery.

905
01:02:08,943 --> 01:02:10,320
An emergency surgery?

906
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:14,741
May I also go into the OR?

907
01:02:17,368 --> 01:02:18,202
What is it?

908
01:02:18,286 --> 01:02:21,205
How lucky can you get? Gosh.

909
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:23,541
Where on earth did
this rarity come from?

910
01:02:24,042 --> 01:02:25,376
Hurry up and get ready.

911
01:02:26,085 --> 01:02:27,962
I'll teach you a lesson today.

912
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:49,651
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

913
01:03:03,915 --> 01:03:05,625
The CT scan seems to show damage

914
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,388
in the anterior
and posterior tibial artery

915
01:03:07,543 --> 01:03:09,743
in the distalis region
rather than the popliteal artery.

916
01:03:10,546 --> 01:03:12,382
We'll have to do some exploring,

917
01:03:12,465 --> 01:03:14,842
but from what I saw
while putting on the splints,

918
01:03:15,635 --> 01:03:17,470
it seems to be the deep peroneal nerve.

919
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:22,737
Eunjae, what about the artery anastomosis?

920
01:03:22,809 --> 01:03:24,602
There's a lot of tissue damage around it,

921
01:03:24,686 --> 01:03:27,105
so I'm considering
a GSV graft from the other side.

922
01:03:27,188 --> 01:03:28,940
In order to prevent
compartment syndrome,

923
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,359
Munjeong is considering
a fasciotomy as well.

924
01:03:31,442 --> 01:03:33,194
What will you do about the peroneal nerve?

925
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:38,616
Gauze.

926
01:03:43,496 --> 01:03:44,831
Okay. Bovie.

927
01:03:51,796 --> 01:03:52,796
Hold here.

928
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:54,340
Forceps.

929
01:03:56,718 --> 01:03:57,927
Metzenbaum scissors.

930
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,433
Sorry, sir.

931
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:10,565
Remove the spleen.

932
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:17,113
Gauze, please.

933
01:04:23,035 --> 01:04:24,203
Suture.

934
01:04:33,171 --> 01:04:34,380
Get Master Kim on the line.

935
01:04:38,926 --> 01:04:40,303
Master,

936
01:04:40,386 --> 01:04:41,763
we'll finish suturing in five.

937
01:04:42,472 --> 01:04:43,752
Will we start with neurorrhaphy?

938
01:04:43,806 --> 01:04:45,850
<i>What are you saying?
The arteries come first.</i>

939
01:04:45,933 --> 01:04:47,268
He's on the national team.

940
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:50,813
If we don't stitch up the nerves soon,
he might never get to jump again.

941
01:04:50,897 --> 01:04:54,567
If we don't get to his arteries soon,
he might lose his whole leg.

942
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:56,151
Master.

943
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:05,869
Master.

944
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,215
Cut.

945
01:05:18,007 --> 01:05:20,009
Jang Donghwa, you do the closing sutures.

946
01:05:20,092 --> 01:05:21,092
Within three minutes.

947
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:26,974
Dr. Jang.

948
01:05:33,022 --> 01:05:34,023
Give it to me.

949
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:36,859
Master.

950
01:05:36,943 --> 01:05:38,569
Can't we do the neurorrhaphy first?

951
01:05:39,153 --> 01:05:40,154
Seo Woojin.

952
01:05:40,238 --> 01:05:42,883
A fracture this serious means
the end of the injury site is crushed.

953
01:05:42,907 --> 01:05:45,201
Even if you do a neurorrhaphy
after exploring,

954
01:05:45,284 --> 01:05:48,371
the viability is too low.
We can't delay the artery anastomosis.

955
01:05:48,454 --> 01:05:50,289
If he doesn't recover
from the nerve injury,

956
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:52,208
his life as an athlete is over anyway.

957
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,460
Either way,
it's a death sentence for that man.

958
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:57,004
Still, rather than taking a risk,

959
01:05:57,088 --> 01:05:59,632
I think it's right to do
the arterial surgery first, Dr. Seo.

960
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:02,885
Nerves start to die
the moment they sustain an injury.

961
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:05,409
Then isn't it best to stitch them
back up as soon as possible?

962
01:06:06,222 --> 01:06:09,100
Master Kim.
With your speed, it's possible.

963
01:06:14,856 --> 01:06:16,023
Master.

964
01:06:16,524 --> 01:06:18,734
Why are you hesitating?

965
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:20,318
Hm?

966
01:06:22,613 --> 01:06:24,740
All surgeries must prioritize
the patient's life.

967
01:06:24,824 --> 01:06:26,158
Next is the patient's safety.

968
01:06:26,868 --> 01:06:29,078
Decisions on function come last.

969
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:32,039
Everyone in here knows that.

970
01:06:32,123 --> 01:06:33,416
So why are you wasting time?

971
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:36,210
You're not thinking

972
01:06:37,295 --> 01:06:40,256
of doing a neurorrhaphy first
like a madman, are you?

973
01:06:40,339 --> 01:06:44,385
We're contemplating what would be
the best method for this patient.

974
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:46,345
So why are you contemplating that?

975
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,181
The order to save him is already set.

976
01:06:49,265 --> 01:06:50,474
To that patient,

977
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:53,477
his life as an athlete
is also on the line.

978
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:56,290
If you miss the timing to operate,
he will lose his life as an athlete

979
01:06:56,314 --> 01:06:57,148
as well as his leg.

980
01:06:57,231 --> 01:07:00,276
Or, he might not lose either one.

981
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,783
All right, Ms. Oh.

982
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:10,328
Could you check the complexion
of the patient's left foot?

983
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:23,799
It's looking good, Master Kim.

984
01:07:28,262 --> 01:07:31,599
Woojin. How much longer do you need
to finish closing?

985
01:07:32,892 --> 01:07:34,101
Dr. Jang Donghwa.

986
01:07:36,896 --> 01:07:37,896
I'm done.

987
01:07:38,814 --> 01:07:40,066
- Cut.
- Cut.

988
01:07:41,692 --> 01:07:43,361
We're done closing, Master Kim.

989
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:46,572
Are we doing the arteries first?
Or the neurorrhaphy?

990
01:07:59,168 --> 01:08:00,252
Neurorrhaphy first.

991
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,465
Okay, the neurorrhaphy first.

992
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:06,592
You shouldn't look
at the patient's perspective.

993
01:08:09,929 --> 01:08:12,223
You must look at the symptoms, Dr. Bu.

994
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:15,601
That's why I just checked his symptoms.

995
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:18,729
Didn't you hear the complexion
in his left foot is back?

996
01:08:18,813 --> 01:08:19,939
That means

997
01:08:20,022 --> 01:08:24,568
one of the two arteries
hasn't been damaged. And that means

998
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:29,323
it won't be too much of a risk
to stitch up the nerves first.

999
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:32,827
Don't be such an amateur.

1000
01:08:35,371 --> 01:08:36,371
Are you getting rusty?

1001
01:08:39,959 --> 01:08:42,003
Gosh, he knows everything.

1002
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:44,046
He even had that in mind.

1003
01:08:45,548 --> 01:08:46,590
Let's go in, Dr. Cha.

1004
01:08:48,426 --> 01:08:49,593
Oh, okay.

1005
01:08:49,677 --> 01:08:50,761
Cha Eunjae,

1006
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:54,098
are you saying
you will go into that surgery?

1007
01:08:54,682 --> 01:08:55,516
What?

1008
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:58,936
You will participate
in that impulsive and reckless surgery?

1009
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,312
It's not reckless.

1010
01:09:00,813 --> 01:09:03,190
He sees what we can't see.

1011
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:06,110
Master Kim has a lot of experience
dealing with trauma.

1012
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:07,194
Yes, that's right.

1013
01:09:10,197 --> 01:09:11,365
Whoever it is,

1014
01:09:12,116 --> 01:09:14,910
no matter what he does
or what position he is in,

1015
01:09:15,745 --> 01:09:17,288
he doesn't think about anything else.

1016
01:09:18,497 --> 01:09:20,499
He just keeps one thing in mind.

1017
01:09:21,459 --> 01:09:22,460
Save the patient.

1018
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:24,795
Save the patient, no matter what.

1019
01:09:26,589 --> 01:09:30,801
That was Master Kim's first lesson
that he taught us.

1020
01:09:30,885 --> 01:09:35,181
Do you think that's a surgery
to save a person's life?

1021
01:09:35,264 --> 01:09:36,849
For that patient,

1022
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,061
his life as an athlete
is a part of his life.

1023
01:09:41,771 --> 01:09:42,813
You guys…

1024
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:46,275
are just as crazy as he is.

1025
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:51,447
Sometimes, there are levels
that you can't reach without going crazy.

1026
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:53,783
And Master Kim…

1027
01:09:58,579 --> 01:09:59,830
calls it romance.

1028
01:10:01,582 --> 01:10:02,583
Romance?

1029
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:06,045
In a field
where people's lives are at stake,

1030
01:10:06,462 --> 01:10:07,755
he talks about finding romance?

1031
01:10:07,838 --> 01:10:08,838
Yes.

1032
01:10:09,799 --> 01:10:14,261
That's how we've been saving people
up until now, Professor.

1033
01:10:20,643 --> 01:10:22,770
Cha Eunjae, aren't you going?

1034
01:10:23,354 --> 01:10:24,355
If not, I'll go.

1035
01:10:30,194 --> 01:10:31,862
Dad, let's talk later.

1036
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:35,740
Woojin.

1037
01:11:13,904 --> 01:11:14,904
Romance?

1038
01:11:18,284 --> 01:11:19,410
Romance, you say?

1039
01:11:22,413 --> 01:11:23,455
Mm.

1040
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,840
Scalpel.

<i>In all things…</i>

1043

go be a judge or prosecutor
